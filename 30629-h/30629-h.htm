    <h2>
      WITH HUZ AND BABY JILL IN THE PASTURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little&#8211;Chicken Little!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton&#8217;s face was flushed with the heat. She was frying
      doughnuts over a hot stove and had been calling Chicken Little at
      intervals for the past ten minutes. Providence did not seem to have
      designed Mrs. Morton for frying doughnuts. She was very sensitive to heat
      and had little taste for cooking. She had laid aside her silks and laces
      on coming to the ranch, but the poise and dignity that come from years of
      gentle living were still hers. Her formal manner always seemed a trifle
      out of place in the old farm kitchen. On this particular morning she was
      both annoyed and indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_12"></a>12</span>&#8220;She is
      the most provoking child!&#8221; she exclaimed in exasperation as Dr.
      Morton stepped into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Provoking&#8211;who?&#8211;Chicken Little? What&#8217;s the matter
      now?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That child is a perfect fly-away. I can no more lay my hands on her
      when I need her than I could on a flea. She is off to the pasture, or out
      watching the men plow, or trotting away, no one knows where, with the two
      pups. And the worst of it is you encourage her in it, Father. You forget
      she is thirteen years old&#8211;almost a woman in size! She is too old to
      be such a tomboy. She should be spending her time on her music and sewing,
      or learning to cook&#8211;now that school&#8217;s out for the summer.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, let up on the music for a year or two, Mother. Chicken Little&#8217;s
      developing finely. She&#8217;s a first rate little cook already. You
      couldn&#8217;t have prepared a better breakfast yourself than she gave us
      that morning you were sick. You don&#8217;t realize how much she does help
      you, and as to running about the farm, that will be the making of her. She
      is growing tall and strong and rosy. You don&#8217;t want to make her into
      an old woman.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It is all very well to talk, Father, but I intend to have my only
      daughter an accomplished lady, and I think you ought to help me. She is
      too old to be <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_13"></a>13</span>wasting
      her time this way. But have you any idea where she is? I want to send her
      over to Benton&#8217;s after eggs. I have used all mine up for settings,
      and I can&#8217;t make the custard pies you are so fond of, till I get
      some.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I have an exact idea where she is. Set your kettle back on the
      stove a moment and come and see.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton followed him, leaving her doughnuts rather reluctantly. Ranch
      life had proved full of hardships to her. The hardships had been
      intensified because it was almost impossible to secure competent servants,
      or, indeed, servants of any kind. The farmer&#8217;s daughters were proud&#8211;too
      proud to work in a neighbor&#8217;s kitchen even if they went shabby or,
      as often happened among the poorer ones, barefoot, for lack of the money
      they might easily have earned. Mrs. Morton was not a strong woman and the
      unaccustomed drudgery was telling on her health and spirits. Dr. Morton,
      on the other hand, enjoyed the open-air life and the freedom from
      conventional dress and other hampering niceties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton followed her husband through the long dining room and little
      hall to the square parlor beyond. He stopped in the doorway and motioned
      her to come quietly. Jane sat curled up in a big <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_14"></a>14</span>chair with two fat,
      limp collie pups fast asleep in her lap. She was so lost in a book that
      she scarcely seemed to breathe in the minute or two they stood and watched
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, I declare, why didn&#8217;t she answer me when I called?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little,&#8221; Dr. Morton called softly. Chicken Little
      read placidly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little,&#8221;&#8211;a little louder. Still no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little,&#8221; her father raised his voice. Chicken Little
      never batted an eyelash. One of the dogs looked up with an inquiring
      expression, but apparently satisfying himself that he was not to be
      disturbed, dozed off again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little&#8211;Chick-en Lit-tle!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ye-es,&#8221; the girl came to life enough to reply absently. Dr.
      Morton turned to his wife with a triumphant grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Now, do you see why she didn&#8217;t answer? She is several
      thousand miles and some hundreds of years away, and she can&#8217;t get
      back in a hurry&#8211;blest be the concentration of childhood!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What is it she&#8217;s reading?&#8221;

      &#8220;Kennilworth. Amy Robsart is probably waiting for Leicester at this
      identical moment. Why return to prosaic errands and eggs when you can
      revel in a world of romance so easily?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_15"></a>15</span>&#8220;Father,
      you will ruin that child with your indulgence!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton walked deliberately across the room and removed the book from
      her daughter&#8217;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane came to herself with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, Mother!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;How many times have I told you, little daughter, that there is to
      be no novel-reading until your work and your practising are both done?
      Here I have been calling you for several minutes and you don&#8217;t heed
      any more than if you were miles away. I shall put this book away till
      evening. Come, I want you to go over to Benton&#8217;s and get me four
      dozen eggs.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane got up inwardly protesting, and in so doing, tumbled the two
      surprised and grumbling pups upon the floor. She didn&#8217;t mind doing
      the errand. She was unusually willing to be helpful though often very
      heedless about noticing that help was needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Can I go by the pasture, Father? It&#8217;s a lot shorter than
      round by the road.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I think it&#8217;s perfectly safe. There are only about thirty
      head of steers there now, and they won&#8217;t pay any attention to you.
      Well, I must be off. Do you want anything from town, Mother?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I have a list.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Get it ready, will you, while I go across and see what Marian&#8217;s
      commissions are.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_16"></a>16</span>&#8220;Across&#8221;
      meant across the road to the white cottage where Frank and Marian and
      their beloved baby daughter, Jill, lived. Little Jill was two and a half
      years old and everybody&#8217;s pet, from Jim Bart, the hired man, to
      &#8220;Anjen,&#8221; which was Jilly&#8217;s rendering of Auntie Jane.
      Even Huz and Buz, the two collie pups, followed her about adoringly,
      licking her hands and face when opportunity offered, to her great
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do way, Huz, do way, Buz,&#8221; was frequently heard, followed by
      a wail if their attentions persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family watched Dr. Morton drive away in the spring wagon down the long
      tree-bordered lane. When he was out of sight, Jane picked up the egg
      basket and started off toward the pasture gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Where are you going, Chicken Little?&#8221; Marian called after
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;To Benton&#8217;s for eggs.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;To Benton&#8217;s? Let me see, that&#8217;s less than a quarter of
      a mile, isn&#8217;t it? I wonder if you&#8217;d mind taking Jilly along.
      She could walk that far if you&#8217;d go slow, and it&#8217;s such a
      lovely day, I&#8217;d like to have her out in the sunshine&#8211;and I&#8217;m
      horribly busy this morning.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ll take her. Come on, Jilly, you lump of
      sweetness, we&#8217;ll pick some pretty flowers. <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_17"></a>17</span>You aren&#8217;t in a
      great hurry for the eggs, are you, Mother?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, if you get back by eleven it will be all right. I have to
      finish the doughnuts and do several other things before I will be ready
      for the pies.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s a whole hour&#8211;we can get back easy in an hour&#8211;can&#8217;t
      we, Jilly-Dilly?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian in spite of her busy morning watched them till they entered the
      pasture, the sturdy little baby figure pattering along importantly beside
      the tall slim girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;How fast they&#8217;re both growing,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;Jane&#8217;s
      always so sweet with Jilly&#8211;I feel safe when she&#8217;s with her.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;O Jane,&#8221; she called a moment later, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
      take the pups along if you are going through the pasture. The cattle don&#8217;t
      like small dogs.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Huz and Buz, after lazily watching the children walk off, had apparently
      decided to join them, and were bringing up the rear a few yards behind.
      They were fat, rollicking pups, too young and clumsy to be very firm on
      their legs as yet. Jane turned round and ordered the rascals home. Marian
      called them back also, and after deliberating a moment uncertainly, they
      obeyed. They were encouraged to make a choice by a small stick Chicken
      Little hurled at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_18"></a>18</span>&#8220;Go on,&#8221;
      said Marian, &#8220;I&#8217;ll see that they don&#8217;t follow you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She coaxed the dogs round to the back of the house and saw them greedily
      lapping a saucer of milk before she went back to her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buz settled down contentedly in the sunshine after the repast was over,
      but Huz, who was more adventurous, hadn&#8217;t forgotten that his beloved
      Jane and Jilly were starting off some place without him. He gave the
      saucer a parting lick around its outer edge to make sure he wasn&#8217;t
      missing anything, then watched the kitchen door for some fifty seconds
      with ears perked up, to see whether any further refreshments or commands
      might be expected from that quarter. Marian was singing gaily about her
      work in a remote part of the cottage, and Huz presently trotted off round
      the corner of the house after the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had gone some distance into the pasture, but he tagged along as fast
      as his wobbling legs would carry him, whining occasionally because he was
      getting tired and felt lonesome so far behind. Huz had never gone out into
      the world alone before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane and Jilly were enjoying themselves. It was late May and the prairies
      were billowy with soft waving grasses and gaily tinted with myriads of
      wild flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Aren&#8217;t they lovely, Jilly?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_19"></a>19</span>Chicken Little
      filled one tiny moist hand with bright blossoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And see, dear, here&#8217;s a sensitive plant! Look close and see
      what the baby leaves do when Anjen touches them. See, they all lie down
      close to the mamma stem&#8211;isn&#8217;t that funny?. Now watch, after a
      little they&#8217;ll all open up again. Here&#8217;s another. Jilly, touch
      this one.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jilly poked out one fat finger doubtfully, and after some coaxing, gave
      the pert green leaves a quick dab. They drooped and the child laughed
      gleefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do, Mamma, &#8217;eaves do, Mamma!&#8221; she shouted. She insisted
      on touching every spray in sight. So absorbed were they in this pretty
      sport they did not notice that a group of steers off to the right had
      lifted their heads from their grazing and were looking in their direction.
      Neither did they see a small black and white pup, whose pink ribbon of a
      tongue was lolling out of his mouth as he, panting from his unusual
      exertions, approached them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huz had been game. Having set out to come, he had come, but Huz was
      intuitive. He realized in his doggish consciousness that he wasn&#8217;t
      wanted and he deemed it wise not to make his presence known.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Chicken Little and Jilly loitered, he stretched himself out for a
      much-needed rest, keeping one eye on them and the other on the grazing
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_20"></a>20</span>steers, who
      stopped frequently to cast curious glances at the intruders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the children walked on and Huz softly pattered along a few paces
      in the rear. All went well until they came abreast of the steers. Chicken
      Little was amazed to see the foremost one lift his head, then start slowly
      toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;perhaps he thinks we&#8217;ve
      got salt for him.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Huz saw the movement, too, and some instinct of his shepherd blood
      asserted itself. He evidently considered the approach of the steer
      menacing and felt it his duty to interfere. With a sharp little staccato
      bark he dashed off in the direction of the herd as fast as his fat legs
      would carry him. His dash had much the effect of a pebble thrown into a
      pool, which gradually sets the whole surface of the water in motion. One
      by one the steers stopped grazing and faced in his direction, snuffing and
      hesitant. Huz yapped and continued to approach them boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little saw the culprit with a shiver of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;O Huz&#8211;you rascal! Oh, dear, and cattle hate a little dog!
      Come back here, Huz&#8211;Huz! Huz&#8211;shut up, you scamp!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Huz, like many misguided human beings, thought he saw his duty and was
      doing it, regardless <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_21"></a>21</span>of
      possible consequences. He heeded Chicken Little to the extent of stopping
      in his tracks but persisted in his sharp yapping. The nearest steer began
      to move toward him, the others, one by one, gradually following.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was frightened, though at first, only for poor foolish
      little Huz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ll kill him if he doesn&#8217;t stop! He can&#8217;t
      drive cattle, the silly goose! Huz! Huz! Come here! Hush up!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Huz retreated slowly as the steers approached. The many pairs of hostile
      eyes and the long horns pointed in his direction were beginning to strike
      terror into his doggish heart, but his nerve was still good and he barked
      to the limit of his lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steers came on faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane&#8217;s breath grew quick and short as she watched them. The children
      were too far from either fence to escape the steers by flight. Even if she
      were alone, she could not hope to outrun them, and with Jilly, the case
      would be hopeless. There was only one thing to be done. She had seen
      enough of cattle during the past three years to know exactly what that was&#8211;she
      must drive them back. Putting Jilly behind her, she gathered up some loose
      stones and commenced to hurl them at the advancing steers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Hi there! Hi, hi!&#8221; she yelled fiercely, starting <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_22"></a>22</span>toward them
      brandishing her arms. The cattle paused, wavered, might have turned, but
      Huz, being thus reinforced, barked lustily again. The steers edged forward
      as if fascinated by this small, noisy object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Huz, Huz, why can&#8217;t you be still?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gathering up Jilly in her arms and bidding her hold tight and be very
      quiet, Chicken Little started on the run to Huz and speedily cuffed him
      into silence. But the steers were still curious and resentful. As she
      started to walk on, with Huz slinking crestfallen at her heels, the cattle
      moved after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to get him out of sight!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked him up by the scruff of his neck and put him into Jilly&#8217;s
      chubby arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Here, Honey, you hold Huz, and slap him hard if he barks. Bad Huz
      to bark!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jilly hugged the dog tight. &#8220;Huz bark, Jilly sap,&#8221; she
      remarked complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cattle stopped when the dog disappeared from the ground. Chicken
      Little started toward them carrying her double burden and yelling &#8220;Hi,
      hi!&#8221; until they gave back a little. She persisted until she
      succeeded in heading them away from the road. Then she started on across
      the pasture still carrying Jilly and Huz, afraid to set either of them
      down lest they should attract the cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_23"></a>23</span>But the herd&#8217;s
      curiosity had been thoroughly aroused. They were uneasy, and by the time
      Chicken Little had walked a hundred yards further on, they had faced
      toward her again and stood with heads up and tails waving, watching her.
      She began to walk rapidly, not daring to run lest she should give out
      under the child&#8217;s weight. Another twenty yards and the steers were
      following slowly after her. She quickened her pace; the herd also came
      faster. Chicken Little knew cattle were often stampeded by mere trifles.
      Jilly, seeing the bristling horns approaching, commenced to whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do home, Anjen, do home&#8211;Jilly&#8217;s &#8217;faid!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane soothed the child in a voice that was fast growing shaky with terror.
      &#8220;I mustn&#8217;t get scared and lose my head,&#8221; she argued with
      herself. &#8220;Father says that&#8217;s the worst thing you can do in
      danger. I must keep them back! Marian trusted me with Jilly&#8211;I must
      be brave!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning resolutely she confronted the herd, yelling and waving till with
      great exertion she headed them about once more. This time she gained a
      couple of hundred yards before they followed. Jilly, peeping fearfully
      over her shoulder, gave her warning. When she looked back and saw those
      thirty pair of sharp horns turned again in their direction, the girl gave
      a sob of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not another human being in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_24"></a>24</span>The soft,
      undulating green of the prairie seemed to sweep around them like a sea.
      Jane looked up into the warm, blue sky overhead and prayed out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;O Lord, please keep them back. I&#8217;m doing the best I can, God,
      but&#8211;but&#8211;it&#8217;s so far to the fence! I truly am, Lord, and
      Jilly&#8217;s so little!&#8221; &#8220;Hi there, hi, hi! Yes, Jilly, yes,
      course Anjen&#8217;ll take care of you!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her panic-stricken tones were hardly reassuring, the child wailed louder,
      casting frightened glances at the steers, then burying her face on Jane&#8217;s
      shoulder. The cattle were approaching on the trot, their great bodies
      swinging and jostling beneath that thicket of horns as the animals in the
      rear pushed and crowded against the leaders. The steady thud of their
      hoofs seemed to shake the ground rhythmically. Jilly could hear even when
      she couldn&#8217;t see, and clung convulsively to Anjen with one arm while
      the other squeezed tight the chastened Huz. Chicken Little sent up a last
      petition, as gathering up her remaining shreds of courage, she charged
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;O God, please, please, help a little!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She never knew exactly what happened after that. Jilly was past all
      control. She was screaming steadily but her anguished howls were almost
      providential for they helped out Jane&#8217;s weakening <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_25"></a>25</span>shouts. Again and
      again Jane turned the steers, her voice growing fainter and hoarser. The
      cattle seemed to gather impetus with each rush&#8211;the distance between
      them was fast lessening and the beasts became more and more unruly about
      going back. But in some miraculous way she kept them off until Mr. Benton,
      plowing in a field near the fence, was attracted by Jilly&#8217;s screams
      and rushed to their rescue. Driving away the steers, he lifted Jilly and
      Huz from Chicken Little&#8217;s aching arms, and took them all in to his
      wife to be comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some little time before Chicken Little could give the Benton&#8217;s
      an intelligible account of what had excited the steers. Mr. Benton&#8217;s
      astonishment was unbounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, Chicken Little, I&#8217;ll never say another word &#8217;bout
      city folks being skeery. You ain&#8217;t so bad for a tenderfoot. How&#8217;d
      you know enough to face them that way instead of running? If you&#8217;d
      run they&#8217;d trampled you all into mince meat! Steers are the
      terablist critters!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was too shaky to answer with anything but a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Benton refreshed them with milk and cookies and after the children
      had recovered from their fright, Mr. Benton drove them home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank came to lift Jilly from the buggy and Mr. Benton related their
      adventure with a relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_26"></a>26</span>&#8220;Clean
      grit, that sister of yours!&#8221; he ended. &#8220;She never even let go
      of that plaguey dog. The tears was a streamin&#8217; down her face and I
      low she&#8217;d pray one minute and let out a yell at them blasted steers
      the next.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears stood in Frank&#8217;s eyes as he hugged both Jane and Jilly
      close after Mr. Benton drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget this, little sister.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, Frank, it was the only thing I could do. Marian trusted Jilly
      to me and I couldn&#8217;t let poor little Huz be killed!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Huz evidently approved this last sentiment, for he gambolled around the
      group, doing his doggish best to please.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little&#8217;s modesty, however, was destined to be short-lived.
      By the time her mother and Marian and Ernest had all praised and made much
      of her exploit, she felt herself a real heroine. She was a natural-born
      dreamer, and she spent the remainder of the day in misty visions of
      wondrous adventures in which she always played the leading part.

      HARKING BACK TO CENTERVILLE

    <p>
      Mrs. Morton was sitting by the dining room window one afternoon about a
      week later, busily knitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Here comes Father, Jane. Run out and get the mail. There should be
      a letter from Alice telling about the wedding and when they are coming.&#8221;

      &#8220;Oh, I do hope there is!&#8221; Chicken Little flew out the door and
      down the path to the road where Father was unloading bundles before he
      drove on to the stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;From Alice? Yes, and one from Katy and Gertie, and three for
      Marian. She&#8217;s the popular lady this time.&#8221; Dr. Morton handed
      out the treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Hurry, Mother,&#8221; Chicken Little fairly wriggled <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_28"></a>28</span>with eagerness as she
      tossed the letters into her mother&#8217;s lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t be so impatient, child! Little ladies should cultivate
      repose of manner. Where are my spectacles? I was sure I laid them on the
      desk.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton was peering around anxiously on desk and table and mantel,
      when Chicken Little suddenly began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;On your head, Mumsey, on your head! Hurry up and read the letter&#8211;I
      just can&#8217;t wait.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother carefully unfolded the sheets and read them to herself
      deliberately before satisfying Jane&#8217;s curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They are not coming until the last of June,&#8221; she said
      finally. &#8220;Dick has an important case set for the tenth and they
      would have to make a hurried trip if they came before that, so they have
      settled down in the old home till the law suit is over. Then they are
      coming for a nice long visit. Alice says if Dick wins the case they are
      going clear to San Francisco, but if he doesn&#8217;t, they&#8217;ll go
      only as far as Denver. Oh, here&#8217;s a note for you, Chicken Little,
      from Dick. And Alice says, perhaps they&#8217;ll bring Katy and Gertie
      with them, if it is convenient for us to entertain so many, and leave them
      here while they go on out West. Dear me, I don&#8217;t know! Gertie hasn&#8217;t
      been very well, it seems, and Mrs. Halford is anxious to have her <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_29"></a>29</span>go to the country
      somewhere. Why, child&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane had paused with Dick&#8217;s cherished note half-opened to skip and
      jump deliriously till she was almost breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;O Mother, wouldn&#8217;t that be glorious? You could put another
      bed in my room, and, maybe, they&#8217;d stay all summer. Oh, goody-goody,
      goody, goody, goody!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton coming in, caught her in the midst of her war dance and gave
      her a resounding kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Here, Mother, where did you get this teetotum? We might sell her
      for a mechanical top&#8211;warranted perpetual motion. When the legs give
      out, the tongue still wags.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t care, Father, Katy and Gertie are coming. I just can&#8217;t
      wait!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane hugged her father and did her best to spin his two hundred pounds
      avoirdupois around with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had sobered down a little she remarked doubtfully: &#8220;But,
      Mother, Katy and Gertie didn&#8217;t say a single word about coming, in
      their letter.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Probably Mrs. Halford hasn&#8217;t told them. She would naturally
      write to me first, to find out if it is perfectly convenient for us before
      she roused their expectations. I presume Alice&#8217;s letter is only
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_30"></a>30</span>a suggestion,
      and if I reply to it favorably, Mrs. Halford will write. I shall think it
      over.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Think it over? Why, Mother, you&#8217;re going to ask them to come,
      aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; Chicken Little&#8217;s eyes were big with pained
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My dear, I think it likely that I shall invite them&#8211;it would
      be good for you to have companions of your own class once more. But it
      will mean a great deal of extra work, and unless I can get someone to help
      me, I do not see how I can manage it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mother, I&#8217;ll help, and Katy and Gertie won&#8217;t mind
      washing dishes.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Now, little daughter, we will let the matter rest for a day or two.
      Don&#8217;t you want to hear about Alice&#8217;s wedding?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Read it aloud, Mother Morton.&#8221; It was Marian speaking. She
      was standing in the door with Jilly fresh and rosey from a long nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Jilly doesn&#8217;t seem any the worse for her bump this morning,
      does she?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, that&#8217;s the blessed thing about children, they get over
      things so easily. By the way, Father, Frank told me to tell you that he
      had taken Ernest with him over to the Captain&#8217;s after a load of hay.
      They&#8217;ll probably have supper there and be late getting <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_31"></a>31</span>home&#8211;that is if
      Captain Clarke asks them to stay&#8211;he is such a queer old duck.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t seem very neighborly, according to reports. I&#8217;ve
      found him pleasant the few times I have met him,&#8221; said Dr. Morton,
      &#8220;but let&#8217;s have Alice&#8217;s letter.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton adjusted her spectacles and began to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;<span style="font-variant:small-caps">Dear, Dear Mrs. Morton:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If we could only have had all the Morton family, great and small,
      present, the Harding-Fletcher Nuptials, as Dick insists upon calling our
      wedding&#8211;he quotes from the Cincinnati paper&#8211;would have been
      absolutely perfect. Uncle Joseph and Aunt Clara couldn&#8217;t have done
      more for me if I had been their very own. Aunt Clara insisted upon having
      the big church wedding, which I fear your quiet taste would not approve,
      but it was very lovely. And I do think the atmosphere of a big church and
      the beautiful music are wonderfully impressive. Dick says it&#8217;s the
      proper thing to tie the bridal knot with all the kinks you can invent&#8211;it
      makes it more secure. He said it was miles from the vestry to the chancel
      and his knees got mighty wobbly before he arrived, but after thinking it
      over, he concluded I was worth the walk&#8211;the heathen! Oh, I almost
      forgot to tell you that the sun shone on the bride most gloriously and the
      old <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_32"></a>32</span>church was
      a perfect bower of apple-blossoms and white lilacs. My wedding dress was
      white satin with a train. I wore Aunt Clara&#8217;s wedding veil. It was
      real Brussels lace and I was scared to death for fear something would
      happen to it. I warned Dick off until he declared that the next time he
      got married the bride should either be out in the open, or have a mosquito
      net that wasn&#8217;t perishable. I&#8217;m not going to tell you about my
      trousseau because I intend to bring it along to show you. I want you to be
      surprised, and oh! and ah! over every single thing, because it is so
      wonderful for Alice Fletcher to have such beautiful clothes. Dick is
      looking over my shoulder and he says he thinks it&#8217;s time I learned
      that my name is Alice Harding. He says he&#8217;s going to have a
      half-dozen mottoes printed with&#8212;
    </p>
    <div class="center">
      <p class="tp">
        &#8216;My name is Harding.<br /> On the Cincinnati hills<br /> I lost the
        Fletcher!&#8217;
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      on them, and hang them about our happy home. Tell Chicken Little I&#8217;ve
      saved a big chunk of bride&#8217;s cake for her, and I&#8217;m dying to
      see her. It doesn&#8217;t seem possible that she is almost as tall as
      Marian.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter ran on with much pleasant chatter of the new home, which was
      the same dear old one where Alice had been born, and where the Morton
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_33"></a>33</span>family had
      spent the two happy years that were already beginning to seem a long way
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice had graduated the preceding year, but Uncle Joseph would not listen
      either to her plea that she should pay the money back from her little
      inheritance, or that she should carry out her plan of teaching. He said it
      would be bad enough to give her up to Dick just as they had all learned to
      love her&#8211;she must stay with them as long as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick&#8217;s letter was as full of nonsense as Dick himself. It was
      written with many flourishes to:
    </p>
    <div class="bquote">
      <p>
        &#8220;<span style="font-variant:small-caps">Miss Chicken Little Jane
        Morton,</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:2ex;">
        Big John Creek,
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:4ex;">
        Morris County, Kansas.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#160;
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;Dear Miss Morton,
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;I would respectfully inform you that your dear friend Alice
        Fletcher is no more&#8211;there ain&#8217;t no such person. She made a
        noble end in white satin covered with sticky out things, and her stylish
        aunt&#8217;s lace curtain. She looked very lovely, what I could see of
        her through the curtain. My dear Miss Morton, I beseech you when you get
        married, don&#8217;t wear a window curtain. Because if you do the groom
        and the sympathizing friends can&#8217;t see how hard you are taking it.
        Alice didn&#8217;t look mournful when the plaguey thing was removed, but
        her aunt wept copiously at the train and took all <span
        class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_34"></a>34</span> the starch out of
        Alice&#8217;s fresh linen collar. And Alice said it would be a sight, if
        I mussed it. I don&#8217;t see the connection, do you? Dear Chicken
        Little, I thought about you all the time I wasn&#8217;t thinking about
        Alice, because I remembered a certain other wedding where the dearest
        small girl in the world introduced me to the dearest big girl in the
        world. I thought also of the little partner who wrote a certain letter
        and of many other things&#8211;I didn&#8217;t even forget the baby mice,
        Chicken Little! Alice says she would like to have your name on her
        diploma along with the president&#8217;s because&#8211;well, you know
        why. And they tell us you are Chicken Big now. Thirteen going on, is a
        frightful age! The worst of it is you can never stop &#8216;going on.&#8217;
        I suppose I need not expect to be asked to any doll parties, but, Jane,
        wouldn&#8217;t you&#8211;couldn&#8217;t you, take me fishing when we
        come? I will promise to be as grown up as possible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:right; margin-right:4em;">
        &#8220;Yours,
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:right">
        &#8220;<span style="font-variant:small-caps">Dick.</span>&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;P. S. Do you still read Mary Jane Holmes?&#8221;
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, it is evident Dick Harding is the same old Dick, all right.
      Three years and getting married don&#8217;t seem to have changed him a
      particle,&#8221; laughed Marian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Three years isn&#8217;t a lifetime,&#8221; retorted Dr. Morton,
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_35"></a>35</span>&#8220;if it
      does seem &#8216;quite a spell&#8217; to young people. Thank heaven, it
      has changed you, Marian, from a fragile, pale invalid to a hearty, rosy
      woman! Dr. Allerton knew what he was about when he sent you to a farm to
      get well.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I can&#8217;t be thankful enough, Father Morton, and I don&#8217;t
      forget how kind it was of you all to come out so far with us.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mother is the only one who deserves any thanks&#8211;the rest of us
      were crazy to come. We were tickled to death to have an excuse, eh,
      Chicken Little?&#8221; He tweaked her ear for emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I love the farm, Father, only I wish Ernest could go away to
      school. He&#8217;s awfully worried for fear you won&#8217;t feel able to
      send him to college this fall. He studies every minute when he isn&#8217;t
      too tired.&#8221; Dr. Morton&#8217;s face grew grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s time for the boy to have a better chance. I wanted
      him to go last year, but the drought and the low price of cattle made it
      impossible. And I don&#8217;t quite know how it will be this fall yet.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There mustn&#8217;t be any if about it this fall, Father. Ernest is
      working too hard here and now is the time for his education if he is ever
      to have one,&#8221; Mrs. Morton spoke decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know all that, Mother, but college takes ready money, and money
      is mighty scarce these days. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_36"></a>36</span>He&#8217;s
      pretty well prepared for college. I&#8217;ve seen to that, if we do live
      on a Kansas ranch.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It isn&#8217;t just the studies, though, Father Morton,&#8221; said
      Marian. &#8220;Ernest needs companionship. He doesn&#8217;t take to most
      of the boys around here, and I don&#8217;t blame him. They&#8217;re a
      coarse lot, most of them. The McBroom boys are all right, but they live so
      far off and are kept so busy with farm work, he never sees them except
      after church once a month or at the lyceums in winter.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Marian&#8217;s just right, Father. The boy needs the right kind of
      associations; his manners and his English have both deteriorated here,&#8221;
      added Mrs. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Perhaps, Mother, but the boy is sturdy and well and his eyes are
      strong once more, and he is going to make a more worth while man on
      account of this very farm life you despise. But he does need companions. I
      wonder if we couldn&#8217;t get Carol or Sherm out here for the summer
      along with the rest.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Father, do have some mercy on me. I can&#8217;t care for such a
      family!&#8221; Mrs. Morton gasped at this further adding to her burdens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian studied for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mother, if you want to ask him, I&#8217;ll take Sherm, and Ernest,
      too, while Dick and Alice are here. I&#8217;d rather have Sherm than
      Carol, and <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_37"></a>37</span>Mother
      said in her letter that the Dart&#8217;s were having a sad time this year.
      Mr. Dart has been ill for so long.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little had listened in tense silence to this conversation, but she
      couldn&#8217;t keep still any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You are going to ask Katy and Gertie, aren&#8217;t you, Mother?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton smiled but made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to go to work and help Mother if you want any
      favors, Jane,&#8221; her father admonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following week apparently wrought an amazing change in Chicken Little.
      She let novels severely alone&#8211;even her precious set of Waverly
      beckoned in vain from the bookcase shelves. She waited upon her mother
      hand and foot. She set the table without being asked, and brought up the
      milk and butter from the spring house before Mrs. Morton was half ready
      for them. Indeed, she was so unnecessarily prompt that the butter was
      usually soft and messy before the meal was ready. She even practiced five
      minutes over the hour every day for good measure, conscientiously
      informing her mother each time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Bet you can&#8217;t hold out much longer, Sis,&#8221; scoffed
      Ernest, amused at her efforts to be virtuous. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_38"></a>38</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re just doing it to coax Mother
      into inviting Katy and Gertie.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I just bet I can, Ernest Morton. Of course I want her to invite
      Katy and Gertie, but I&#8217;m no old cheat, I thank you, I&#8217;m going
      to help the best I can all summer if she asks &#8217;em.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And if she doesn&#8217;t?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare hint such a thing&#8211;she&#8217;s going to&#8211;I
      think you&#8217;re real hateful! I just don&#8217;t care whether you get
      to go to college or not.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Maybe I don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in Ernest&#8217;s tone made Jane glance up in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t want to? Why, you&#8217;ve been daffy about it&#8211;you
      haven&#8217;t thought about anything else for a year!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s so, too, but I guess I can change my mind, can&#8217;t
      I?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest lounged on the edge of the table and looked at his sister
      teasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was almost six feet tall, slim and muscular, with the unruly lock of
      hair sticking up in defiance of all brushing as of old, and a skin that
      was still girlishly smooth though he shaved religiously every Sunday
      morning to the family&#8217;s secret amusement. The results of this rite
      were painfully meager. Both Chicken Little and Frank chaffed <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_39"></a>39</span>him unmercifully
      about it. Jane loved to pass her hands over his chin and shriek
      fiendishly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ernest, I believe I felt one. I think&#8211;really, I think you&#8217;ll
      cut &#8217;em by Christmas!&#8221; A lively race usually followed this
      insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank was even meaner. He came into Ernest&#8217;s room one morning while
      he was shaving and gravely pretending to pick up a hog&#8217;s stiff
      bristle from the carpet, held it out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why Ernest, you&#8217;re really growing quite a beard!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ernest was a man in many ways if he had but little need of a razor.
      Seeing other boys so seldom and being thrown so much with men had made him
      rather old for his years and more than ordinarily capable and
      self-reliant. He loved horses and was clever in managing them, breaking in
      many a colt that had tried the patience and courage of his elders. But his
      day dream for the past twelve months had been college. He had confided all
      his hopes and fears to Chicken Little. The love between the two was very
      tender, the more so that they had so few companions of their own ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Chicken Little, knowing that he had fairly lived and breathed and slept
      and eaten college during many months, might be pardoned for her amazement
      at his mysterious words.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_40"></a>40</span>&#8220;Ernest,
      tell me&#8211;what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Nothing&#8217;s the matter&#8211;I&#8217;ve got a new idea, that&#8217;s
      all.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What is it? Where&#8217;d you get it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;From the old captain. Say, you just ought to see his place&#8211;it&#8217;s
      the queerest lay-out. Snug and neat as a pin. He&#8217;s tried to arrange
      everything the way it is on shipboard. He&#8217;s got a Chinaman or a Jap,
      I don&#8217;t know which, for a servant. He is the first one I ever saw,
      though they say there are lots of them in Kansas City. This chap can work
      all right. We had the best supper the evening Frank and I went over for
      hay.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My, I wish I could see it. Do you suppose Father would take me over
      some time?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. They say he hates women&#8211;won&#8217;t have
      one around.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Pshaw, you&#8217;re making that up, but what&#8217;s the idea? Oh,
      you old hateful, you&#8217;re just teasing&#8211;I can tell by your eyes!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Honest Injun, I&#8217;m not any such thing, only you interrupt so
      you don&#8217;t give me a chance. You know the Captain has been at sea for
      twenty-five years&#8211;never&#8217;d quit only his asthma got so bad the
      doctor told him he&#8217;d have to go to a dry climate, and bundled him
      off here to Kansas. Well, he seemed to take a shine to me, and he asked me
      a lot of questions about what I was going to do. <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_41"></a>41</span>Finally, he wanted to
      know why I didn&#8217;t try to get into the Naval Academy instead of going
      to college. Said if he had a son&#8211;and do you know, he turned kind of
      white when he said that, perhaps he&#8217;s lost a boy or something&#8211;he&#8217;d
      send him there.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;O Ernest, and be an officer? I saw a picture of one at Mrs. Wilcox&#8217;s&#8211;her
      nephew&#8211;and his uniform was perfectly grand.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Just like a girl&#8211;always thinking of clothes! But I&#8217;ve
      been thinking perhaps I should like the life. I always like to read about
      naval fights, and our navy&#8217;s always been some pumpkins, if it has
      been small. And the captain says a naval officer has a chance to go all
      over the world. Think of your beloved brother, who has never been on a
      train but six times, sailing away for China or Australia!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little gave a gasp, &#8220;Ernest Morton, it wouldn&#8217;t be a
      bit fair for you to go without me!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I don&#8217;t suppose there&#8217;s one chance
      in a hundred that I could get the appointment. Father knows Senator Pratt,
      and the Captain said he didn&#8217;t think there was as much competition
      for Annapolis out here as for West Point. It&#8217;s so far from the sea.
      But mind, Jane, not a word to anybody till I think it over some more. I&#8217;m
      going to see the Captain again.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_42"></a>42</span>&#8220;O
      Ernest, what if you should go clear round the world?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;&#8217;Twouldn&#8217;t hurt my feelings a bit. But mum&#8217;s the
      word, Sis.&#8221;

    <h2>
      CHICKEN LITTLE PAYS A VISIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton was sitting at her desk writing a letter. Jane hovered about
      inquisitively. She was almost sure it was to Mrs. Halford. And if so, she
      must surely be inviting Katie and Gertie. If she could only be sure. She
      tried in vain to get a glimpse of the heading, but her mother&#8217;s hand
      rested on the paper in such a way as to effectually conceal it. Mrs.
      Morton did not believe in encouraging curious young daughters. But
      opportunity was kind; some one called her mother away. She left the letter
      lying there partly finished. Chicken Little started joyfully across the
      room, but before she had reached the desk, something held her back. She
      had been most carefully trained as to what was honorable; sneaking was not
      tolerated in the Morton family.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_44"></a>44</span>&#8220;No,&#8221;
      she said to herself regretfully, &#8220;I mustn&#8217;t peep behind her
      back! I couldn&#8217;t look anybody in the face if I did.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She slowly turned away. When her mother returned, she glanced sharply at
      Chicken Little quietly reading on the opposite side of the room. The girl
      did not realize that her face proved her innocence. It was so sober that
      her mother felt sure she had not meddled with the letter. Jane had not
      learned to conceal her emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. and Mrs. Morton were both going to town that day. Mrs. Morton drove
      away without satisfying Chicken Little&#8217;s curiosity, which was
      probably largely responsible for what happened. Jane felt injured. She
      thought her mother might tell her whether she could have the girls or not.
      Ten days was enough time for anybody to make up her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank and Ernest were out in the fields harrowing; Marian, busy sewing.
      Chicken Little soon finished the few tasks her mother had left for her and
      time began to hang heavy on her hands. She couldn&#8217;t seem to fix her
      thought on a book because she kept wondering every minute if that letter
      was to Mrs. Halford. She wandered out into the June sunshine and wished
      she could have gone to town, too. Presently she began to feel aggrieved
      because her parents hadn&#8217;t taken her with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the fields she could see the men at work <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_45"></a>45</span>and could
      occasionally hear them calling to the horses. She wished she had a horse
      to ride. The pony that was called hers by courtesy was the mainstay for
      the herding and she could seldom use him at this season. Finally, after
      digging her heels into some loose earth beside the path, she had an
      inspiration. She debated it a moment with herself, then slipped back into
      the house, combed her hair over carefully, tied it with her best ribbon,
      and arrayed herself in her new blue lawn which her mother had distinctly
      told her was to be her second best for the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smoothed it down complacently&#8211;pale blue was becoming to her
      clear, rosy skin&#8211;but her conscience pricked. She succeeded in
      lulling this annoying mentor by reasoning that her mother wouldn&#8217;t
      want her to go visiting in an old dress. She tried to ignore the fact that
      her mother hadn&#8217;t given her permission to go visiting at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slipping out the back way to avoid disturbing Marian, in case she should
      be looking out her window or Jilly should be on the watch, Chicken Little
      whistled softly to Huz and Buz. The puppies were three weeks older and
      stronger than when Huz so nearly caused disaster, and trotted after Jane
      on all her tramps. She was seldom lonesome when she had them rolling and
      tumbling along beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making a wide detour around the white cottage, <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_46"></a>46</span>she struck into a
      faint track skirting the upper fields. There was a nearer way through the
      lower fields along the slough, but Frank had killed several big bull
      snakes there the preceding week. To be sure, these were usually harmless,
      but they were frightful enough to be unpleasant company. Besides, Frank or
      Ernest might see her and ask her where she was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fates speeded her undertaking. No one saw her save a few quail and
      nesting plover that whirred up at her approach and tried to lure her and
      the dogs away from their nests by pretending to be hurt and running a few
      paces ahead on the ground. Chicken Little had seen this bird ruse too
      often to be fooled by it, but Huz and Buz pursued each bird hopefully only
      to come sneaking back, when the mother bird suddenly soared off as soon as
      they had left the nest safely behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You sillies,&#8221; Jane admonished them each time. &#8220;Won&#8217;t
      you ever learn not to be fooled?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She found it delightful to loiter herself. The whole day was before her.
      The wild blackberry bushes along the fence still hid bunches of bloom
      among the half-formed berries. Clumps of white elderberry blossoms spilled
      their fragrance, and the wind rustling through the long stems of the weeds
      and prairie grass droned monotonous tunes. She found tufts of crisp sour
      sheep sorrel which she <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_47"></a>47</span>liked
      to nibble, while she made ladies out of the flowers, and the pups snapped
      at the grasshoppers and butterflies. Chicken Little was taking her time
      for this expedition. She knew her parents would not return before evening,
      and if Marian hunted her up, she would think she had gone down to eat her
      lunch with Frank and Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost noon before she entered the belt of timber along the creek
      at the southern boundary of their ranch. Across the stream, she knew, lay
      the Clarke ranch, and she had heard the house and stables were close to
      the timber. Jane had resolved to call on the Captain, and going on foot,
      had selected the shortest route. It was over two miles between houses by
      the road. Further, Chicken Little, preferred that her visit should seem
      accidental&#8211;at least to the Captain. She hardly expected to convince
      her family that she had wandered over there without intending to. But she
      felt sure the Captain would receive her more kindly if he thought she were
      taking a walk and got lost. She would be very hot and tired when she
      arrived, and ask for a drink so politely that not even a woman-hater would
      have the heart to let her go on without asking her in and offering her
      some refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never been in this part of the woods before. It was very different
      from the timber and <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_48"></a>48</span>groves
      near the ford where they often picnicked in summer or went nutting in the
      fall. There, the cattle and hogs had been allowed to range, at certain
      seasons of the year, until most of the thick undergrowth was nicely
      cleared away. But the wood, here, was dark and shadowy. Dead branches and
      tree trunks lay where they had fallen or been torn down by storms. Weeds
      and flowers had grown up among these, and the wild cucumber vines and
      clematis festooned the rotting logs with feathery green. It was a wood
      full of creepy noises&#8211;noises that made one keep still and listen.
      The coarse grass and herbage were so rank you could scarcely see the
      ground. It looked decidedly snaky, Chicken Little reflected dubiously. And
      water moccasins were abundant along the creek, and poisonous, as her
      father had often warned her. Chicken Little was usually plucky when she
      actually saw a snake, but the snakes she feared she might see always made
      her panicky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still she hated to give up anything she had undertaken. She stood staring
      into the thickets for some minutes. Huz sat on his haunches beside her and
      stared too, whining occasionally as if he didn&#8217;t quite like the
      prospect either. Buz had found a gopher hole and was having a merry time
      trying to dig it out. She could hear the creek singing over the stones a
      few rods away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_49"></a>49</span>&#8220;It can&#8217;t
      be so awfully far,&#8221; she said aloud, &#8220;and I guess the dogs
      would scare away the snakes.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something stirred among the weeds near her. Chicken Little gave a little
      scream. But it was only a squirrel, as Huz immediately discovered. He
      barked loudly and started in pursuit, which sent Mr. Squirrel flying up a
      tree. Jane set her lips together firmly and started forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There&#8217;s no sense in being so scary!&#8221; she admonished
      Huz. &#8220;Snakes most always run away as fast as ever they can, anyway.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, she picked her way daintily and gave a cry of delight when
      after pushing a short distance into the thicket, she found an old rail
      fence apparently leading off in the direction she wished to go. She
      climbed it promptly and worked slowly along its zig zag course&#8211;a
      means of locomotion that was comfortingly safe, if somewhat slow. The pups
      complained over this desertion for they had to worm through the tangle of
      weeds and brambles below.
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon reached the creek only to be confronted by a new problem. There
      were neither stepping stones nor a fallen log to cross upon. Chicken
      Little had to hunt for a shallow place, strip off her shoes and stockings,
      and wade. She wore good old-fashioned high laced shoes and lacing up was a
      tedious process. The woods were a little <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_50"></a>50</span>more open beyond. She had no further need of the
      fence&#8211;it had indolently stopped at the creek anyhow. But, alas, she
      had gone but a short way farther when she came to the creek again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little sputtered volubly to the dogs but the stream flowed
      placidly on. There was nothing for it, but to take off her shoes and
      stockings a second time, and wade. By the time she had laced them, she
      remembered having heard Frank say that the creek was very winding here and
      kept doubling back on its tracks. She was in for it, now, she decided, and
      might as well go ahead. It was long past noon. She was getting hungry. She
      did hope the woman-hater would offer her something to eat. She felt a
      little doubtful about her looks. Sitting down on the damp earth had left
      sundry grass stains and one long black streak on the dainty blue lawn, and
      her hair was wind blown, and mussed where some twigs had caught and pulled
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more Jane unlaced those exasperating shoes, drying her feet on a
      woefully limp and dirty handkerchief. This time she lazily wound the
      lacings around her ankles until she could be sure the creek was safely
      behind her. Presently she heard the cackling of hens and the grunting of
      pigs that assured her she was nearing somebody&#8217;s farmyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Gee, but I&#8217;m glad!&#8221; she muttered thankfully. She sat
      down and laced her boots neatly, then <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_51"></a>51</span>smoothing her hair and ironing out her rumpled
      dress with nimble fingers, she struck off joyfully in the direction of the
      sounds. She was approaching the house from the rear and the barn and
      out-buildings were soon visible through the trees. She hurried forward
      joyfully only to be confronted by that horrible creek flowing once more
      between her and her goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little didn&#8217;t often lose her temper completely, but this was
      the last straw. &#8220;Darn,&#8221; she exclaimed spitefully, &#8220;darn
      you, you old creek, I&#8217;d like to beat you. I won&#8217;t take my
      shoes off again! I just won&#8217;t!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She scanned the bank carefully to see if she could find any rock or log to
      help her out. Nothing available could be seen, but help appeared from a
      most unlooked for quarter. A tall, severe-looking man rose from a rustic
      seat behind a tree which had hidden him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Can I be of any service, Miss?&#8221; he asked courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an awful sinking of the heart she realized this must be Captain
      Clarke himself. Oh! and he must have heard her swear. Chicken Little
      turned the color of a very ripe strawberry and stared at him in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint flicker of amusement lighted the man&#8217;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_52"></a>52</span>&#8220;Just
      wait an instant and I will put a board over for you, if you wish to cross.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane distinctly did not wish to cross this particular moment. She wished
      to run home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I&#8211;I&#8211;please don&#8217;t go to any trouble, I oughtn&#8217;t
      to be here, and please I didn&#8217;t mean to swear but&#8211;but&#8211;Mother
      would be dreadfully ashamed of me if she knew.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was telling the whole truth most unexpectedly to herself. Captain
      Clarke surveyed her sharply but his voice seemed kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You must be Dr. Morton&#8217;s daughter. Did you get lost?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an embarrassing question. Jane looked at him doubtfully before
      replying. If she said &#8220;yes&#8221; she would be telling a lie, and if
      she said &#8220;no,&#8221; he would know she came on purpose. She
      compromised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I wanted to see your house awfully,&#8221; she faltered. &#8220;Ernest
      said it was most like a ship and I&#8217;ve never seen a ship,&#8221; a
      sudden remorseful thought crept into her mind. &#8220;But you mustn&#8217;t
      blame Mother; she didn&#8217;t know I was coming.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain&#8217;s eyes lost their severe look&#8211;the suspicion of a
      twinkle lurked in their blue depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I see, you didn&#8217;t wish to embarrass Mother, so you came
      without leave. I am honored by your visit, Miss&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_53"></a>53</span>&#8220;Jane,
      but people don&#8217;t call me Miss, except Dick Harding, and he does it
      for a joke. I&#8217;m only thirteen.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain was sliding a stout plank across a narrow part of the stream.
      This accomplished, he came half way across and held out his hand. &#8220;Come,
      I&#8217;ll help you over.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little didn&#8217;t in the least need assistance. She was as
      sure-footed as a young goat, but she was too much overcome by this
      delicate attention to refuse. Placing her hand gingerly in his, she let
      him lead her across, then followed meekly up to the low white house. It
      was a one-story structure, divided in the middle by a roofed gallery. The
      entire building was surrounded by a broad veranda, open to the sky, and
      enclosed by a rope railing run through stout oak posts. The Captain
      gravely assisted her up the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I call this my quarter-deck,&#8221; he explained, seeing the
      question in her eyes. &#8220;I have been accustomed to pacing a deck for
      so many years that I didn&#8217;t feel at home without a stretch of
      planking to walk on.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t it nice? I&#8217;ve seen pictures of people on
      ships. My mother came from England on a sailing vessel. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d
      just love the ocean!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke smiled at her encouragingly but made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_54"></a>54</span>Chicken Little
      rambled on nervously. She was decidedly in awe of her host but having
      begun to talk, it seemed easier to keep on than to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I guess it must be wonderful out at sea when the sun is coming up.
      Sometimes I get up early and go out on the prairie to watch it. It just
      keeps on getting lighter and lighter till finally the sun bobs up like a
      great smiling face. I always feel as if it were saying &#8216;Good
      morning, Jane.&#8217; I suppose it&#8217;s a lot grander at sea where you
      can&#8217;t see a single thing but miles and miles of waves. Why, I should
      think you&#8217;d feel as if there wasn&#8217;t anybody in the world but
      you and God. I always feel a lot more religious outdoors than I do in
      church. But Mother says that&#8217;s just a notion. But, you know, the
      people are always so funny and solemn in church and the ministers most all
      talk through their noses or say &#8216;Hm-n&#8217; to fill in when they
      don&#8217;t know what to say next. But, oh dear, I guess you&#8217;ll
      think I&#8217;m dreadful! And please don&#8217;t think I swear that way
      often. I haven&#8217;t for ever so long before.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain&#8217;s face twitched, but he replied gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about the &#8216;Darn,&#8217; child, I&#8217;ve
      heard worse oaths, though I believe young girls are not supposed to use
      strong language. I feel as you do about church and the outdoors. I find it
      irksome <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_55"></a>55</span>to be
      cooped up anywhere. But come in, and I will have Wing Fan give you some
      pigeon pot-pie. We had a famous one for dinner and you surely must be
      hungry. Afterwards, I&#8217;ll show you through The Prairie Maid as I
      sometimes call this craft.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little began to feel at home. &#8220;And to think Ernest said he
      didn&#8217;t like women and girls! Pooh, I knew he was just fooling.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Wing Fan found other things beside the pot-pie, and Chicken Little was
      soon feasting luxuriously with the Chinaman waiting on her most
      deferentially. Her host watched her with a keener interest, had she but
      known it, than he had shown in any human being for many months.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of fifty odd. Naturally reticent, his long voyages in command
      of merchant vessels had fostered an aloofness and love of solitude, which
      had later been intensified by a great grief. His stern bearing had
      repelled his country neighbors in the year he had lived on Big John. He
      was satisfied that it should be so, yet he was intensely lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Chicken Little knew nothing of all this. The thick sprinkling of white
      in his black hair and the deep lines in his face, made her entirely
      comfortable&#8211;they were just like Father&#8217;s. She was too curious
      to verify Ernest&#8217;s tales of the queer house, <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_56"></a>56</span>to give much
      attention to her host at first. She stared around her with wide eyes. Yes,
      there were the funny little built-in cupboards and window seats, and the
      plate racks, and the shelves that let down with gilt chains. Every single
      thing was painted white. &#8220;My, how lovely and clean it all looked!&#8221;
      And the blue Chinese panels; she had never seen anything like them. And
      there were five pictures of ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the dishes were a marvel to her. Jane had seen plenty of fine china
      but never any so curious as this old Blue Canton with its landscapes and
      quaint figures. The Captain was pleased with her ingenuous admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had finished her dinner, he took her across the gallery to his
      library, a room seldom shown to the residents of the creek. Even Ernest
      and Frank hadn&#8217;t seen it, Jane learned later. This apartment was
      quite as marvellous as the dining-room. A long, low room it was, with many
      lacquered and carved cabinets and tables. The wall space above these was
      pictureless, but two great ivory tusks were crossed over a doorway. Above
      the fireplace rows of weapons were ranged&#8211;queer swords and daggers
      with gold and mother-of-pearl on their hilts, a ship&#8217;s cutlass,
      several scimitars, and the strangest guns and pistols. Chicken Little was
      fascinated with the frightful array. A huge bearskin <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_57"></a>57</span>lay on the floor
      among strange, beautifully colored rugs, which reminded her of her mother&#8217;s
      India shawl. Rugs where queer stiff little men and animals that looked as
      if a child had drawn them, wandered about among curlicues and odd
      geometrical patterns. A tiger-skin, head and dangling claws distressingly
      lifelike, hung in the middle of one wall. She was spell-bound for a few
      minutes with the strangeness of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her host seemed to enjoy her wonder. He explained most patiently a great
      compass set on a tripod in one corner. After she had roamed and gazed to
      her heart&#8217;s content, he opened the locked cabinets, and let her take
      miniature ebony elephants from Siam into her hands. He had her look
      through a reading glass at intricate ivory carvings, so tiny, it did not
      seem that human fingers could ever have wrought them. There were boxes of
      sandalwood and ugly heathen idols with leering faces. The drawers were
      crowded with prints and embroideries. The Captain pulled one out that had
      girl&#8217;s things in it. She caught a glimpse of a spangled scarf, and
      fans and laces, even gay-colored beads. But he shut this drawer hastily.
      She did not have time to wonder much about this incident just then, but
      she thought about it a good deal afterwards. The things looked quite new
      as if they had never been used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_58"></a>58</span>Chicken Little
      had natural taste and had read more than most girls of her age. She
      handled the Captain&#8217;s curios reverently, drinking in eagerly his
      explanations and the strange tales of where he had found these wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
      So absorbed were they both, that the shadows were lengthening before
      Captain Clarke realized the afternoon was slipping away, and that home
      folk might be disturbed if he kept his young guest too long. Chicken
      Little was distressed too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m afraid Father and Mother will get home before I do.
      They&#8217;ll be awfully worried!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t try to go back through the woods. They are too
      dense to be a very safe route for a child, and it would be dark before you
      could reach home. I&#8217;ll have one of the men hitch up, and I&#8217;ll
      drive you over.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little commenced to fidget. It would not make her coming scolding
      any lighter, if her parents learned that the Captain had felt in duty
      bound to bring her home. But she did not wish to be rude and it was a long
      walk by the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke saw she was disturbed and began to laugh. Her naïvete
      charmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If my program doesn&#8217;t suit you, won&#8217;t you tell me what
      is wrong? I haven&#8217;t enjoyed anything so much in years as your visit,
      my dear. I should like to pay my debt by doing whatever you would like.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_59"></a>59</span>Jane was
      radiant by the time he had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you truly mind my coming? You aren&#8217;t just being
      polite?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mind? Child, if you ever come to be as lonesome and as old as I am,
      you will know what a comfort it has been to have anyone as young and sweet
      and fresh as you are, around. Just a moment, I want to show you one thing
      more.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into his bedroom and returned with an old photograph. It was a
      likeness of a two-year-old child.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a good look at it, then turned to her host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It is the picture of the little boy I&#8211;I&#8211;lost. He was my
      only one. He&#8211;he would be seventeen now.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why that&#8217;s just Ernest&#8217;s age!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Your brother? The one who was here the other evening?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, he was seventeen his last birthday. I&#8217;m so sorry you
      lost your little boy.&#8221; Chicken Little slipped her hand into his to
      express her sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain did not reply except with an answering pressure. She laid the
      picture down gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He was a beautiful baby&#8211;it almost seems to me I&#8217;ve seen
      someone who looks like him&#8211;especially the eyes. And that merry
      little twist to his mouth. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_60"></a>60</span>I
      can&#8217;t seem to think who it is.&#8221; Jane puckered her forehead and
      the Captain observed her closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Was it some boy?&#8221; He seemed interested in this resemblance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, how silly of me not to remember. It&#8217;s Sherman Dart, one
      of Ernest&#8217;s old friends back in Centerville.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Centerville? That is in Illinois, is it not?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, where we used to live. And the eyes are exactly like Sherm&#8217;s
      and Sherm always twisted his mouth crooked like that when he smiled.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;This boy, he wasn&#8217;t an orphan, was he?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh no, Mr. and Mrs. Dart are both living though Mr. Dart&#8217;s
      been sick a long time.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain seemed to have lost interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, my dear, am I to have the pleasure of driving you home&#8211;I&#8217;m
      afraid your parents will be distressed about you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane had a bright idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Captain Clarke,&#8221; she spoke rather hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Would you mind&#8211;of course it sounds awful of me to ask you&#8211;but&#8211;it&#8217;d
      be so much easier for me with Mother if you&#8217;d just tell her, oh,
      what you said about my being a comfort and not bothering.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was both ashamed and eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain threw back his head and laughed until the tears came into his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_61"></a>61</span>&#8220;My dear,
      I&#8217;ll make this call all right with your mother, never fear, for I
      want you to come again. I am going to ask her if you and Ernest can&#8217;t
      both honor me by coming to dinner next Sunday.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was as good as his word but when Chicken Little went to bed her mother
      said sorrowfully: &#8220;Chicken Little, I shan&#8217;t scold you because
      I promised Captain Clarke I would let you off this time&#8211;but I didn&#8217;t
      think you would do such a thing&#8211;behind my back, too.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      And her mother had asked Katy and Gertie! She had told her after she came
      home that evening.

    <h2>
      A CHERRY PENANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Chicken Little awoke the next morning with a bad taste in her mouth. She
      was ashamed to have grieved her mother by her escapade the day before,
      especially when Mother was undertaking all this extra trouble for her
      happiness. But she just couldn&#8217;t be sorry she had gone to the
      Captain&#8217;s! It would be something to remember all her life. She gave
      a skip of delight every time she thought of all the lovely things&#8211;and
      the Captain&#8217;s stories. No, she simply couldn&#8217;t be sorry, but
      she knew Mother expected her to be sorry. Of course, she might have got
      acquainted with him some other way, but her father wouldn&#8217;t promise
      ever to take her. &#8220;Little girls have too much curiosity for their
      own good, Humbug,&#8221; was all she had been able to get from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_63"></a>63</span>She could see
      at breakfast that Mother expected an apology right away. She could feel
      disapproval in her good morning and in the way she kissed her. Mother
      seemed to have the power to make her feel mean and guilty all over. But
      she wasn&#8217;t sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were doing the dishes she told her mother all about the
      wonderful things she had seen. Mrs. Morton listened in silence. She was
      waiting. Chicken Little heaved a deep sigh and did her best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know it was wrong for me to go without permission, Mother, and I
      won&#8217;t ever do it again, and I think you&#8217;re just beautiful to
      ask Katy and Gertie. I&#8217;ll help every single bit I can; you see if I
      don&#8217;t.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am glad you realize you did very wrong, little daughter, is that
      all you have to say to me?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little looked at her Mother and fidgeted. Her Mother returned her
      look gravely. Still she couldn&#8217;t&#8211;it would be fibbing if she
      did. The silence became oppressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You may go and pick a couple of quarts of cherries, Jane.&#8221;
      Mrs. Morton handed her the tin lard pail, searching her face once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a glorious June morning and Jane enjoyed picking cherries. Marian
      saw her and came too, establishing Jilly comfortably at the foot of the
      tree with a rubber doll and the two pups as companions. Jilly was usually
      a placid baby and she settled down contentedly to trimming up her doll
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_64"></a>64</span>with
      dandelions. Buz, the indolent, curled himself at her feet and was asleep
      inside of five minutes, but Huz looked up longingly into the tree at Jane.
      He seemed to be racking his doggish brain as to the best method of
      reaching her. He kept making little futile leaps, whining impatiently.
      Finally, he stood up on his hind legs, planted his fore paws against the
      tree trunk, and barked dolefully. Jane bent down and mischievously dropped
      a cherry into his open mouth. Huz choked, sputtered, and after a first
      rapturous crunch, hastily deposited the acid fruit upon the ground. He
      looked reproachfully at Chicken Little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There now,&#8221; said Marian, &#8220;he&#8217;ll never trust you
      again.&#8221; Marian raced Chicken Little with the cherry picking and the
      pails were filled far too soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Jane,&#8221; said Marian as she started reluctantly back to the
      house, &#8220;if Mother Morton can spare you this morning to help me pick
      them, I believe I&#8217;ll get some cherries to put up&#8211;there are
      loads ripe this morning.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;d love to, Marian, I&#8217;ll take these in and find out if
      she&#8217;ll let me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She came flying back in a jiffy with two big milk pails. &#8220;All right,
      Mother says I may help you till noon.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a merry morning. The cherry trees lined the lane which was also a
      public road, and several <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_65"></a>65</span>neighbors
      going by, stopped to exchange a few words. Mr. Benton had his joke, for he
      discovered Jane swinging up in the topmost boughs and reaching still
      higher for certain unusually luscious ones that eluded her covetous
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, Mrs. Morton,&#8221; he said, addressing Marian and ignoring
      Chicken Little, &#8220;that&#8217;s the largest variety of robin I&#8217;ve
      ever seen in these parts. I &#8217;low you must have brought the seed from
      the east with you. You wouldn&#8217;t mind if I took a shot at it, I
      &#8217;spose. &#8217;Pears like birds of that size must be mighty
      destructive to cherries.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why Mr. Benton, we shouldn&#8217;t like to have you kill our birds;
      we&#8217;re attached to them. But you are mistaken, that isn&#8217;t a
      robin, it&#8217;s a Jane bird&#8211;they&#8217;re rare around here.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Benton laughed and Chicken Little got even by hurling a big cluster of
      cherries at him. She aimed them at his lap, but they struck him full in
      the face to her great glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well now, them Jane birds ain&#8217;t so bad.&#8221; Mr. Benton
      remarked eating the fruit with a relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning sped by briskly. Jilly created a diversion by getting her
      small self into trouble. Marian noticed that she was picking something off
      the tree trunk and putting it into the pocket of her little ruffled apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_66"></a>66</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s
      Jilly getting there? Can you see, Chicken Little?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little twisted and peered until she could take a good look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why&#8211;Marian, I do believe it&#8217;s ants! The silly baby&#8211;they&#8217;ll
      bite her!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian hurried down the tree to rescue her offspring, but not before Jilly
      set up a wail of anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Naughty sings bite Jilly!&#8221; she moaned, as her Mother picked
      the small tormentors off her arms and bare legs. But Jilly was a sunny
      child, and as soon as the pain eased, found a smile and remarked
      complacently: &#8220;Ants bite Jilly, too bad, too bad!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane braced herself firmly in a crotch where the red fruit was thickest
      and picked mechanically while she unburdened her mind of the previous day&#8217;s
      doings. She chattered about her adventures till Marian could have repeated
      every word of her conversation with the Captain off by heart, and might
      have given a pretty accurate inventory of his possessions, or at least the
      portion of them that Jane had seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian was genuinely interested and liked to hear Chicken Little tell it
      all, but she wondered what Mrs. Morton had thought about the junketing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But what did your Mother say, dear?&#8221; she asked finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;She didn&#8217;t like it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_67"></a>67</span>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t
      suppose she would, did you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;N-o-o, but&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;d never have got to go if I&#8217;d waited for permission.
      And, Marian,&#8221; Chicken Little thought it was time to change the
      subject, &#8220;how do you make yourself be sorry, when you ought to be
      and aren&#8217;t?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian wanted to laugh but she saw her young sister had not intended to be
      funny. She half guessed the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why Jane, I hardly know, the old monks used to set themselves
      penances to atone for their sins.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Did it make them really sorry? Do you think?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, yes, I should think it must have or they would never have had
      the courage to persist in them. Some of their penances were terribly
      severe such as beating themselves with knotted ropes, but I shouldn&#8217;t
      advise anything of that kind for you. You might try to make up for your
      fault in some way. Perhaps you might give up something you like very much.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane didn&#8217;t say anything more, and it was a day or two later before
      Marian learned the effect of her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cherry trees seemed full as ever after they had gathered all Marian
      wanted, and in the evening <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_68"></a>68</span>Mrs.
      Morton sent Chicken Little out to gather more for her. Marian offered to
      help her, and they were once more aloft in the trees when Mr. Benton
      returned from town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian began to chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He&#8217;ll think we have been here all day, Jane. Let&#8217;s
      pretend we have.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Dear me, Mr. Benton, back so soon. How fast the day has gone by.
      Jane, you must be awfully hungry, I hadn&#8217;t realized it was so late!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well now, time does beat everything for speed, but I &#8217;lowed
      it was only our ancestors as lived in trees all the time, Mrs. Morton. But
      then I&#8217;ve heard they&#8217;re gettin&#8217; a lot of new-fangled
      ways down east. You&#8217;re not calculatin&#8217; to take up your
      residence permanent like in them cherry trees, are you? In case you don&#8217;t
      want the cottage any more, we might move it over to our place just by way
      of being neighborly.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Benton, I&#8217;ll remember your kind offer if it
      ever gets in our way.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not many days before the mail brought a grateful letter from Mrs.
      Halford, and ecstatic ones from the girls, in reply to Mrs. Morton&#8217;s
      invitation. They would arrive with Alice and Dick and Sherm&#8211;for
      Sherm was coming, too&#8211;on the twentieth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Not quite two weeks. That means we must begin <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_69"></a>69</span>getting ready at
      once, and you mustn&#8217;t think because we have a servant coming, that
      you won&#8217;t need to help, Jane. One girl can&#8217;t do all the work
      for so many.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little had not yet said she was sorry and her Mother was inclined
      to be severe with her in consequence. Mrs. Morton was rather worried, too,
      because she had seemed pale and listless for two or three days past. But
      when she asked if she were not feeling well, Chicken Little had replied
      carelessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, I&#8217;m all right, Mother.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were hurrying to get the cherry crop cared for before the guests
      arrived. There would be enough to do after they came to keep them all busy
      without preserving, Mrs. Morton declared. One day when they were seeding
      cherries, Marian noticed that Jane was eating only half ripe ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What on earth are you eating those green things for, child?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, just for fun.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, it won&#8217;t be funny if you eat many of them. I don&#8217;t
      know anything that&#8217;ll make you sick quicker than green cherries.
      They&#8217;re acid enough when they&#8217;re ripe.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hurry of preparing for the guests, Marian thought nothing further
      about it. Three nights later, Dr. Morton wakened them at midnight to <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_70"></a>70</span>know if they had any
      calomel. &#8220;The Chicken&#8217;s mighty sick,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And
      I gave the last I had to Mrs. Benton for Mary.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I haven&#8217;t any calomel, Father, but I&#8217;ve got some castor
      oil,&#8221; Marian announced after some rummaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That will go hard with Jane, she loathes it. But she&#8217;ll have
      to take it down I guess. I can&#8217;t imagine what ails her, she&#8217;s
      vomiting and has a high fever.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden recollection struck Marian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Maybe she has been eating too many cherries.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ripe cherries oughtn&#8217;t to hurt her and they have been
      plentiful so long, I shouldn&#8217;t think she would overeat.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But I have seen her eating them when they weren&#8217;t ripe. I
      believe that&#8217;s what is the matter.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I hope so, I have been a little afraid of scarlet fever from her
      symptoms.&#8221; Dr. Morton seemed relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone, Marian turned to Frank. She had been recalling several
      things and putting them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Frank Morton, I verily believe that sister of yours has been eating
      half-ripe cherries for a penance.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Penance? Penance for what?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_71"></a>71</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t
      exactly know, but it has something to do with her running off to the
      Captain&#8217;s.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, if she&#8217;s as big a fool as all that, she deserves to
      have a stomach ache. Come, stop worrying.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But Frank, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m the guilty one who suggested
      the idea to her. Goodness knows, I hadn&#8217;t the slightest intention of
      doing so.&#8221; Marian related the whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, Sis certainly gets queer notions into her head, but it may
      not be that at all. Anyhow, you can&#8217;t do anything to-night.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A very pallid forlorn girl sat propped up in bed about noon the following
      day. The family, having discovered that it was nothing serious, and that
      she had probably brought it on by her own folly, were not sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What in the dickens did you want to go and eat green cherries for,
      when there were pounds and pounds of ripe ones going to waste on the
      trees?&#8221; Ernest&#8217;s look of utter disgust was hard to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank came over with a handful of minute green walnuts interspersed with a
      choice assortment of gooseberries and green plums. He handed them to her
      with a mocking bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;In case you get hungry, Jane dear, I thought you might like to have
      a supply of your favorite food on hand.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_72"></a>72</span>Chicken Little
      thanked him spunkily, but when the door closed behind him, she buried her
      face in the pillow and mourned over her woes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll never try to be good again, so there, and I think they&#8217;re
      all just as mean as can be.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her pillow was getting wetter and wetter and her spirits closer and closer
      to zero, when the door gently opened and her father came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why Chicken Little, crying? This won&#8217;t do. Come, tell Father
      what&#8217;s the matter. You aren&#8217;t feeling worse, are you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little swallowed hard and did her best to choke back the tears,
      but the tears having been distinctly encouraged for the past ten minutes
      had too good a start to be easily checked. Dr. Morton gathered her into
      his arms and patted and soothed her till she was able to summon a moist
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Hurry up and tell me now&#8211;a trouble shared is a trouble half
      cured, you know.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jane was beginning to be ashamed of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t anything really, Father, only I feel so
      miserable and the boys have been making fun of me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Making fun, what about?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, just because.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Because what, out with it!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Because I ate green cherries, I suppose.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_73"></a>73</span>&#8220;How long
      have you been eating green cherries, Jane?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane considered. &#8220;Most a week.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And don&#8217;t you think you deserve to be laughed at, for doing
      anything so foolish?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They didn&#8217;t laugh at the monks&#8211;and they were grown-up
      men.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Monks? What do you mean?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, I just guess they did things that made them sicker than
      eating green cherries, and I didn&#8217;t intend to eat enough to make me
      sick, but I didn&#8217;t seem to feel any sorrier and&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was stopped suddenly by the expression of her Father&#8217;s
      face. He tried to control himself but the laugh would come.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had finally got the atmosphere cleared a bit, he inquired, still
      smiling: &#8220;Well, are you sorry now you went to the Captain&#8217;s?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little smiled back. &#8220;No, I&#8217;m just sorry I grieved
      Mother.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Then suppose we vote this penance idea a failure and don&#8217;t
      try it again.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next few days were so full of the bustle of preparation that Jane soon
      forgot she had ever been sick. Further, there was a mystery on foot. She
      and Ernest had not been permitted to accept the Captain&#8217;s invitation
      to dinner for reasons that Mrs. Morton explained with great care to that
      gentleman. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_74"></a>74</span>But
      he had been invited over to dine with them. He was so reserved and silent
      on this occasion that both Mrs. Morton and Marian wondered at Jane&#8217;s
      devotion. After dinner he had a long conversation with Dr. Morton and
      Ernest, and no teasing on Jane&#8217;s part could extract the faintest
      hint from either as to what it had been about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It was about your going to Annapolis, I bet.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Nope, you&#8217;re a long way off. We didn&#8217;t say anything
      more than what you and Mother heard. Father&#8217;s written to the
      Senator. Captain Clarke got him all enthused; the Captain promised to
      write, too. But you&#8217;ll never guess the other, and it has something
      to do with you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been obliged to give it up. Ernest had at length reached an age
      where he could keep a secret. The exasperating part of it was that Ernest
      was going over to Captain Clarke&#8217;s every evening and she wasn&#8217;t
      asked once. Her pride was so hurt that she came near being sorry she had
      gone to see the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening before the fateful twentieth, Mrs. Morton and Jane were
      putting the last touches on the guest room and on Chicken Little&#8217;s
      own chamber, which Katy and Gertie were to share with her. The fresh
      fluted muslin curtains were looped back primly. The guest room had been
      freshly papered with a dainty floral design, in which corn flowers <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_75"></a>75</span>and wheat ears
      clustered with faint hued impossible blossoms, known only to designers.
      Both rooms looked fresh and cool and summery, and the windows opening out
      upon the garden and orchard revealed also wide stretches of the prairie
      beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little had re-arranged the furniture in her room at least six
      times in a resolute endeavor to get the best possible effect. Marian had
      given her a picture of some long stemmed pink roses that exactly matched
      the buds in her paper, and she had begged an old Japanese fan from her
      Mother. This was decorated with a remarkably healthy pink sunset on a gray
      green ground, and she tacked it up as a finishing touch above the bed
      lounge, which was destined to be a bone of contention among the three
      little girls for the remainder of the summer. At first, not one of the
      three was willing to be cast upon this desert island of a bed, while the
      other two were whispering secrets in the big walnut four-poster. But as
      the weather grew hotter, the advantages of sleeping alone became more
      obvious, and they had to settle the matter by taking turns. Chicken Little
      did her very best to make her room look like the Captain&#8217;s, but
      except for her Mother&#8217;s concession of fresh white paint, a few books
      on a shelf, and the foreign fan, it was hard to detect any very marked
      resemblance. Nevertheless, both <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_76"></a>76</span>Jane and her Mother gazed upon their handiwork
      with deep satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If Annie will only stay through the summer,&#8221; sighed Mrs.
      Morton, &#8220;she is doing so beautifully I&#8217;m afraid she is too
      good to last. But I mustn&#8217;t borrow trouble. If she deserts me, our
      guests will simply have to turn in and help, much as I should dislike to
      have them.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest came in to supper so excited he could scarcely eat. And Dr. Morton
      seemed almost as interested as Ernest. They were both provokingly
      mysterious during the entire meal, talking over Jane&#8217;s head in a way
      that was maddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Does Mother know?&#8221; she demanded finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Mother knows. I tell Mother when I go over to the Captain&#8217;s.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Come now, Ernest, that&#8217;s been harped on enough,&#8221; said
      Dr. Morton, then turning to Jane, &#8220;If you will hurry and get into
      your riding habit, you shall know the secret inside of an hour.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to say that Chicken Little hurried. The black brilliantine
      skirt fairly flew over her head, the border of shot in its hem rapping her
      rudely as it slid to the floor with a thud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh dear, I don&#8217;t see why girls have to wear such long, silly
      skirts and ride sidewise. It&#8217;s so much easier to ride man fashion.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_77"></a>77</span>Chicken Little
      had been permitted to ride man fashion since she had been on the ranch,
      for safety. But this year her Mother had decided she was too big to be
      playing the boy any longer, and had made her a woman&#8217;s habit, in
      spite of the Doctor&#8217;s protests. Jane was proud of the smart basque
      with its long tails and glittering rows of steel buttons, but she loathed
      the skirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily fastening the black velvet band with its dangling jet fringe below
      her stiff linen collar, she cast a parting glance at the oval mirror and
      skurried down the stairs, not stopping for such small matters as gloves or
      cap or even her beloved riding whip. Ordinarily, she would not have budged
      without the whip. It had been a Christmas present from Ernest and was her
      special pride. Her haste was in vain. After one look, her Mother sent her
      back for cap and gloves. &#8220;I do not wish my daughter riding around
      bareheaded like some half wild thing. I don&#8217;t mind on the ranch, but
      when you go abroad I wish you to look like a lady.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane reluctantly obeyed and did not forget the whip this time. She had a
      fresh rebuff when she reached the road. Instead of the saddle horses she
      expected to see, Dr. Morton and Ernest were awaiting her in the spring
      wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, Father, I thought you said to put on my riding habit.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_78"></a>78</span>&#8220;Maybe I
      did. But never mind, jump in just as you are&#8211;it&#8217;s getting a
      little late.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little tried to hide her disappointment. She maintained a
      dignified silence until they had crossed the ford and Ernest turned the
      horses toward Captain Clarke&#8217;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s at the Captain&#8217;s.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her Father nodded and began talking carelessly to Ernest about putting the
      orchard in clover another year. She saw there was no information to be
      had, until he was good and ready. Ernest took pity on her, however, just
      as they turned in the Captain&#8217;s gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;In exactly six minutes you will see the surprise, even if you don&#8217;t
      recognize it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little strained her eyes half expecting to see Katy or Gertie
      appear miraculously from nowhere. But they drove into the door yard
      without seeing anything or anybody that could possibly interest her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain was evidently watching for them. He helped her down from the
      high wagon in his most courtly manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am consumed with curiosity to know whether you have pried the
      secret from that brother of yours. I infer you have from your habit.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Habit?&#8221; Jane glanced swiftly from her host&#8217;s <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_79"></a>79</span>quizzical face to her
      father and Ernest. They were both smiling broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, it has something to do with horses&#8211;but&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She never finished the sentence for at that moment one of the Captain&#8217;s
      hands appeared leading two Indian ponies, one a red and white piebald with
      a red blanket and side saddle; the other a black, with a blue blanket and
      a Mexican cowboy&#8217;s equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at the horses and she stared at the Captain, not daring to even
      hope what had come into her mind. Captain Clarke took the bridle off the
      piebald and held down his hand for her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Up with you, I have persuaded your Father to share his children
      with me to the extent of letting me add something to your pleasure and
      that of your guests this summer. Ernest, however, has left me his debtor
      in advance, for he has not only finished breaking these in to the saddle
      but he has tamed the worst-tempered colt on the place as well.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was surprised to see Ernest flush up and stammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why I&#8211;I don&#8217;t want any pay&#8211;I was glad to help out
      a neighbor.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what I am going to ask you to do, my boy, to
      help me out by letting me feel that I can still give somebody pleasure.
      The ponies are part of a large herd I bought in Texas and cost <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_80"></a>80</span>me very little. I
      have argued this all out with your Father and he understands my feeling.
      Won&#8217;t you be as generous?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Ernest could answer, Chicken Little reached up both arms and gave
      the speaker a hug and a kiss that were warm enough to satisfy the
      loneliest heart. Before she had released him, Ernest had hold of his hand
      and was trying to make up by the vigor of his hand shake for the
      embarrassing dumbness which had seized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton relieved the situation by remarking mischievously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ask Ernest who&#8217;s surprised now, Chicken Little?&#8221;

    <h2>
      THE GUESTS ARRIVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Morton family were up early the next morning. Jane was in a state of
      prickly excitement between her delight over her wonderful pony, all her
      very own, and the expected pleasure of seeing Katy and Gertie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If the others have grown as much as you kids, we shan&#8217;t
      recognize them,&#8221; said Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Anyhow, we can tell which bunch to cut out by Alice and Dick,&#8221;
      Ernest answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton was horrified. &#8220;Ernest, the idea of your talking about
      our friends as if they were cattle! I do trust you children will not
      mortify me before our guests by using such vulgar expressions.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Never mind, Mother,&#8221; Frank consoled her, &#8220;Alice and
      Dick will revel in these vulgar westernisms. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_82"></a>82</span>See if they don&#8217;t. Why Mother, it&#8217;s
      by slang that a language is enriched, didn&#8217;t you know that?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That will do, Frank. I should think you would try to help me keep
      up correct standards instead of hindering. You will feel very differently
      when Jilly is a little older.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The train was due at two-thirty at the neighboring town of Garland&#8211;the
      neighboring town being some nine miles distant. They decided to have an
      early dinner at home, then Dr. Morton would drive the spring wagon in for
      the guests, Frank would take the farm wagon for the trunks, while Jane and
      Ernest formed a sort of ornamental body guard on their new ponies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My, but you present an imposing appearance!&#8221; laughed Marian
      coming out to the road with Jilly to see them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We do look rather patriarchal,&#8221; said Frank, glancing around
      at the impressive array. &#8220;If we only had you and Mother mounted on
      donkeys, the reception committee would be complete. I will do my best to
      apologize for your absence.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If you are late, send Jane on ahead, they can see her a mile off on
      that calico pony.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The piebald is conspicuous,&#8221; said the Doctor, &#8220;I guess
      Captain Clarke picked him out for the Chicken so her mother could see her
      from afar.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little ignored this pleasantry. &#8220;Thank <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_83"></a>83</span>you for saying
      calico, Marian. I was just wondering what to call him and that will do
      beautifully.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, have some mercy on the poor beast,&#8221; put in Ernest.
      &#8220;Think of his having to answer to the name of Calico. Why don&#8217;t
      you call him gingham apron or something really choice?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Allee samee, his name&#8217;s Calico. If you want to call yours,
      Star of the Night or Aladdin or something high falutin, you just can.&#8221;
      Jane set her lips firmly. She didn&#8217;t specially care for Calico but
      she wasn&#8217;t going to be laughed out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That will do, children, it&#8217;s time to be off.&#8221; Dr.
      Morton suited the action to the word by clucking to the team of bays he
      drove, and the procession started.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the station in good time. Both Ernest and Chicken Little
      wanted to stay on their mounts and dash up beside the train, but their
      father forbade it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Those ponies have never been properly introduced to an engine, and
      I don&#8217;t wish to take you back in baskets. You can show off
      sufficiently going home.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      So the ponies were left with the teams at a safe distance from the
      railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train was twenty minutes late and it seemed an age to Chicken Little.
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you always have to wait for nice things,
      while the unpleasant <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_84"></a>84</span>ones
      come along without ever being asked,&#8221; she complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What about the ponies? Do you class them with the unpleasant
      things?&#8221; queried her father. &#8220;But here comes the train.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane watched it puff in with a roar and a rattle and sundry bangs, her
      eyes strained for the first glimpse of Katy and Gertie, Alice and Dick.
      She really didn&#8217;t know which one she wanted to see worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Bet Sherm will be the first one out,&#8221; said Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Bet you Katy will!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was Dick who hailed them first, before he turned to help down the
      little girls. Alice came next, with Sherm who was still rather bashful,
      bringing up the rear loaded down with satchels and lunch baskets. Katy and
      Gertie fell upon Chicken Little instantly and Alice had to embrace the
      whole bunch, because they kept on hugging and kissing Jane, laughing
      hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Here, where do I come in?&#8221; Dick rescued Jane from her friends
      and gave her a resounding smack himself. After which he held up his hands
      and exclaimed: &#8220;Say, Doctor Morton, what do you feed these infants
      on to make them grow so fast? Jane&#8217;s a half head taller than either
      Katie or Gertie and we thought Sherm would surely top Ernest. In fact, we
      had our money on him to beat any of your <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_85"></a>85</span>mushroom Kansas effects, but Holy Smoke, I have
      to look up to Ernest myself.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice and Katie and Gertie were looking at Jane&#8217;s riding habit,
      Gertie in considerable alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We don&#8217;t have to ride to the ranch on horseback, do we?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the doctor could reassure them, Frank replied gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Of course, what did you expect in Kansas? We&#8217;ve brought six
      horses and we thought two of the girls could ride in front of Dick and
      myself. It&#8217;s only nine miles and the horses don&#8217;t gallop all
      the way.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls looked panic-stricken, even Alice seemed a little dazed, Frank
      was so very plausible. Dick helped him on delightfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I told you, Alice, you&#8217;d better put your riding habit in your
      satchel. I suppose the horses are gentle, Frank.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, they don&#8217;t often throw anyone that&#8217;s used to them.
      Naturally, they&#8217;re a little gayer in summer when they&#8217;re in
      the pasture so much.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest could not resist adding his bit. &#8220;I was thrown three times
      last week, would you like to try my pony, Katy?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      This revealed the game to Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You awful fibbers, don&#8217;t you believe a word they say, girls.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_86"></a>86</span>&#8220;Honest
      Injun,&#8221; said Ernest, &#8220;I was.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s the truth,&#8221; Frank confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little Gertie, who was already beginning to realize that she was very
      far from home and in a strange land besides, commenced to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton came promptly to the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;ll do, boys. Save your joking till our guests are rested
      from their journey at least. Frank, you and Dick look up the trunks while
      Ernest and Sherm help me bring up the wagons. It&#8217;s all right, dear,&#8221;
      he put his arm reassuringly around Gertie, &#8220;you shall ride in one of
      the most comfortable of vehicles if we haven&#8217;t a carriage to offer
      you. You mustn&#8217;t pay any attention to their teasing.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first two miles of their homeward journey, Chicken Little gave
      up her pony to Sherm and climbed in with the girls. Ernest offered to
      change saddles, but Sherm declared he didn&#8217;t mind the side saddle
      and cheerfully bore all the jokes the party cut at his expense. Dr. Morton
      watched him approvingly. &#8220;Good stuff,&#8221; he said to himself, as
      Sherm returned the sallies without wincing. The boy&#8217;s long legs
      dangling from the side saddle were a comical sight. Sherm, if not quite so
      tall as Ernest, was rather better proportioned and delightfully supple and
      muscular. He was the same matter-of-fact, straight-forward boy he had
      always been, <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_87"></a>87</span>but
      his father&#8217;s long illness had sobered him, though he could be
      hilarious, as he was proving now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Say, Sherm,&#8221; Katy prodded, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you borrow
      Jane&#8217;s riding skirt too?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Sherm, go the lengths&#8211;you&#8217;d make a beautiful girl,&#8221;
      teased Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm laughed. &#8220;Chicken Little may have something to say to that!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I thought you&#8217;d be making excuses.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm was not to be bluffed. &#8220;Not much, hand it over, Chicken
      Little.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You never can get into it, Sherm.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;ll you bet?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;ll be too small around the waist.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton stopped and Jane hastily slipped off the skirt, presenting
      rather a funny appearance herself with her habit basque and the blue lawn
      dress showing beneath. Sherm dismounted, turning Calico over to Ernest to
      hold. The entire party shouted when Jane reached up on tiptoe to throw the
      clumsy skirt over his head. Sherm neglected to hold it, and the shot in
      the hem promptly dropped it to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Gee,&#8221; exclaimed Sherm, &#8220;the cranky thing seems to have
      a mind of its own.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the girls want to wear the pesky things
      for,&#8221; grumbled Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They don&#8217;t want to wear them&#8211;but their pernickety <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_88"></a>88</span>brothers and fathers
      and husbands consider them modest,&#8221; Alice hit back promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I consider them very dangerous,&#8221; said Dr. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this bantering was going on, Chicken Little was vainly endeavoring
      to fasten the band around Sherm&#8217;s waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;ll just have to squeeze in, Sherm. I can never make it
      meet,&#8221; she giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m squeezing in, I tell you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a triumphant pull, Jane got the band buttoned and Sherm heaved a sigh
      of relief&#8211;a disastrous sigh&#8211;it sent the button flying and the
      weighted skirt once more slid to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Drat it!&#8221; Sherm groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Now, you said you&#8217;d wear it. Don&#8217;t let him back out,
      Chicken Little,&#8221; Katy urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Who said anything about backing out?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to get a string, Jane. Haven&#8217;t you a piece
      in your pocket, Frank?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank produced the string and by dint of using it generously, the skirt
      was finally secured and Sherm still allowed some breathing room.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girls were not yet satisfied. Katy insisted upon lending him her
      leghorn hat and Alice contributed a veil. Gertie offered a hair ribbon
      which Chicken Little slyly pinned to the collar of Sherm&#8217;s coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_89"></a>89</span>He was a sight
      for the gods when he finally remounted. But he carried it off with a dash,
      assuming various kittenish airs and coquetries, even waving saucily at two
      cowboys who passed them and turned to stare in bewilderment at his bizarre
      costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ride home passed quickly with all this fun. Gertie cheered up and
      enjoyed the prairie sights as much as the others. Gertie seemed the same
      little girl of three years before except for her added inches, but Katy
      had many little grown-up airs and graces and evidently felt the importance
      of her fourteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Almost fifteen,&#8221; she answered Dr. Morton when he inquired her
      age. The two girls were dressed alike still, but Katy managed in some
      subtle way to give her clothes a different air from Gertie&#8217;s.
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know just what the difference is,&#8221; Marian
      remarked to Alice a day or two after their coming, &#8220;but Katy is
      stylish and Gertie demurely sweet in the self-same dress.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Personality will out, even in children,&#8221; Alice replied.
      &#8220;They are both unusually bright and well brought up, but Katy is
      ambitious and likes to cut a bit of a dash, and Gertie doesn&#8217;t. She
      is a home and mother girl. I am amazed that she screwed up her courage to
      come so far without her mother. I fear she is already a trifle homesick,
      though she <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_90"></a>90</span>is
      enjoying every minute, and is enchanted with the chickens and pups and all
      this outdoor life.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little found out these things more gradually. On the long ride
      home from the station they chattered busily. All three felt a little shy
      for the first minutes but there was so much to tell. Katy had finished her
      freshman year in the High School and spun great tales of their doings.
      Carol had graduated the week before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He is awfully handsome, Chicken Little. All the girls are mashed on
      him.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Are what, Katy?&#8221; demanded Alice who had been listening to
      Dick and Dr. Morton with one ear open for the girl&#8217;s confidences.
      She felt rather responsible to Mrs. Halford for Katy and Gertie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy colored. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care, Alice, that&#8217;s what all the
      girls say, and I can&#8217;t be goody-goody and proper all the time.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;All right, Katy, if you think Mother likes that kind of slang, I
      don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy didn&#8217;t say anything further to Alice, but when she resumed her
      story to Jane, she said: &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care what you call it,
      but they all are! And he just smiles in that lazy way of his and doesn&#8217;t
      put himself out for anybody. He didn&#8217;t even take a girl to the
      senior party, and lots of the Senior girls had to go in a bunch because
      they didn&#8217;t have an escort.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_91"></a>91</span>&#8220;But he
      had awfully good marks,&#8221; added Gertie, &#8220;and Prof. Slocum said
      he could have been Valedictorian just as well as not if he had tried a
      little harder.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble&#8211;he&#8217;s too lazy to try. I guess
      if he goes to the Naval Academy as he wants to, he&#8217;ll have to get
      over being lazy.&#8221; Katy evidently wasted no sympathy on Carol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mention of the Naval Academy fired Jane. She shouted the news to
      Ernest who was some distance ahead with Sherm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Sherm&#8217;s just told me,&#8221; he called back, &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t
      it be scrumptious if we both got to go?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, is Ernest going?&#8221; Katy and Alice and Dick all exclaimed
      nearly in unison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little told them all about Ernest&#8217;s plans and about the
      Captain. Katy wished to call on this fascinating individual immediately.
      But Dr. Morton suggested that he thought they would all be tired enough to
      rest for the remainder of the day by the time they arrived at the ranch.
      They were, but not too tired to enjoy Mrs. Morton&#8217;s hearty country
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick ate hot biscuit and creamed potatoes and fried chicken till Alice
      declared she shouldn&#8217;t have the face to stay a month, if he gorged
      like that all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;ll stop keeping tab on his appetite before <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_92"></a>92</span>you have been here
      many days, Alice. You&#8217;ll be busy satisfying your own. You will find
      country air a marvellous tonic,&#8221; Dr. Morton assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all amused to see Katy looking in shocked amazement at Gertie
      who had just been persuaded to have a second heaping saucer of raspberries
      and cream. To be sure, Katy herself had had two drumsticks and a breast.
      But she considered being served twice to dessert away from home highly
      improper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I wish it were a little later in the season so Ernest could bring
      us in quail for you,&#8221; said Mrs. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Quail?&#8221; Dick&#8217;s face lighted. &#8220;Is the hunting
      still good around here?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Excellent for quail and prairie chicken, and the plover are
      plentiful at certain seasons,&#8221; Dr. Morton replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They found two deer on the creek last winter,&#8221; added Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, there are a few strays left but the day for them has
      practically gone by.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Dick, if you go hunting you&#8217;ve got to take me.&#8221; Alice
      put her hands on her husband&#8217;s shoulders and rested her chin on his
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Barkus is willing if you can stand the tramp.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We don&#8217;t tramp, we drive. It&#8217;s a trifle too early for
      hunting, but by the latter part of next <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_93"></a>93</span>week, you might try it. You can take the boys
      and spring wagon and have an all-day picnic. I can spare them, and Ernest
      for a guide.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Can we all go?&#8221; Katy started up excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Of course, I can shoot a little,&#8221; Chicken Little sounded
      patronizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Chicken Little can shoot but she never hits anything&#8211;she
      always shuts her eyes before she pulls the trigger,&#8221; Ernest called
      her down promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s no such thing, Ernest Morton, I killed a quail once,
      didn&#8217;t I, Father?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Dick, if you&#8217;ll come and unrope our trunks, I think we&#8217;d
      better be getting our things out,&#8221; said Alice an hour later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yours to command, Captain. I am perishing to have Chicken Little
      see my present.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Jane, what do you think? Dick had to go and pick you out a
      gift all by himself&#8211;he wasn&#8217;t satisfied with my efforts. And
      he has the impudence to insist that you will like his best.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a package for you, too, but I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s
      in it. Mother wouldn&#8217;t let us see. Let&#8217;s go unpack quick,
      Gertie, and find out.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And I want to show my trousseau! Shall I get it out to-night, Mrs.
      Morton, or wait till morning?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;To-night, Alice,&#8221; spoke up Marian, &#8220;I want to see it
      and I&#8217;ll be busy in the morning. I am pining to see some pretty
      clothes.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_94"></a>94</span>Dick had
      already vanished into the upper regions and he called down airily: &#8220;Doors
      open, ladies. World renowned aggregation of feminine wearing apparel,
      including one pair of the very latest hoops and the youngest thing in
      bustles, now on exhibition.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton looked shocked, and Marian and Alice tried to control their
      amusement. &#8220;The heathen, I warned him to be good.&#8221; Alice
      laughed in spite of herself with an apologetic glance at Mrs. Morton. The
      girls had bolted upstairs at the first words of Dick&#8217;s invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Come on, Mother, don&#8217;t mind Dick&#8217;s nonsense,&#8221;
      said Marian, linking her arm in hers and gently drawing her up. &#8220;It
      will do you good to see Alice&#8217;s pretty things.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick held the door open for them with a deep salaam. Alice held up a
      finger warningly with an imperceptible gesture in Mrs. Morton&#8217;s
      direction. He shrugged his shoulders repentantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Now, Alice, if you&#8217;ll just dig out my particular parcel I&#8217;ll
      vamoose. Women complain that men never take an interest in their affairs
      and then if a misguided chap tries to act intelligent, he is snubbed.&#8221;
      Dick&#8217;s tone sounded injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice kissed the tip of his ear and shoved him out of the way. &#8220;You&#8217;re
      so big, Dick, there&#8217;s never room for anyone else when you&#8217;re
      around.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_95"></a>95</span>Alice deftly
      opened trays and lids, pulling out protecting papers; she handed Dick a
      large flat parcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick received it with his hand on his heart, then striking an oratorical
      attitude, addressed Jane in the formal tone he used in court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ladies, Miss Chicken Little Jane Morton, I have the great honor on
      this suspicious occasion to present to you on behalf of my unworthy self,
      a slight testimonial of my deep respect and undying affection&#8211;Alice,
      stop winking at Marian&#8211;Mrs. Morton, is it fitting for a wife to stop
      the flow of her husband&#8217;s eloquence by winking? I wish you&#8217;d
      take Alice in hand. I think she needs some lessons in the proprieties. As
      I was saying, I wish to present this trifle to you, and the only
      expression of gratitude I desire in return, is thirty kisses to be
      delivered one daily, on or before the twelfth hour of each day, to which
      witness my seal and hand.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      With another bow, he resigned the parcel to Chicken Little.
    </p>
    <p>
      She promptly tendered one kiss in advance. Then stripped off the papers
      with eager fingers. A charming white leghorn hat appeared. It was faced
      with pale blue and trimmed with knots of apple blossoms and black velvet
      ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;How charming!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_96"></a>96</span>&#8220;Dick, I
      didn&#8217;t suppose you had such good taste!&#8221; added Marian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Try it on quick, Chicken Little.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little&#8217;s shining eyes and clear, fair skin fitted like a
      charm under the pale blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick was jubilant. &#8220;I saw that hat in a shop window and I thought it
      looked exactly like Chicken Little. Who says a man can&#8217;t pick out a
      hat?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He departed without waiting for any disparaging remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice&#8217;s present came next, a charming muslin with sash and hair
      ribbons the exact shade of the blue hat facing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If it only fits, Jane. I left some to let out in the hem, but you
      are bigger every way than I thought. I tried it on Katie.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Changing it a little at the waist will make it perfect,&#8221;
      Marian reassured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I am so glad it is snug, and just the right length, Alice.
      Mother&#8211;&#8221; Chicken Little stopped suddenly, she couldn&#8217;t
      be criticising mother before company. &#8220;You see I grow so dreadfully
      fast that Mother has to make everything too big so it&#8217;ll last a
      while.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian supplemented this explanation later to Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Poor child, Mother Morton does make her clothes too big! And it
      doesn&#8217;t do a bit of good <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_97"></a>97</span>for they hang on her the whole season and by the
      next they&#8217;re either worn or faded&#8211;and she generally manages to
      out-grow them, in spite of their bigness.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&#8217;s parcel was found to contain candy and a duck of a fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Alice&#8217;s wedding things soon put everything else in the shade.
      The dainty sets of underwear with their complicated puffs and insertings,
      frilled petticoats, silk and muslin and poplin gowns, hats and parasols,
      lay in a rainbow colored heap on the bed and chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Alice,&#8221; said Marian, caressing some of the dainty lingerie,
      &#8220;who is going to iron all these puffs and ruffles? It would take
      hours to do them right, especially the petticoats.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know, Marian&#8211;I asked Aunt Clara the same question. And do
      you know what I have done?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her audience looked interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I just went down town the minute I got to Centerville and got some
      nice strong muslin and I&#8217;ve been making it up perfectly plain except
      for a tiny edge. They are heaps more comfortable&#8211;and I wear these
      others for best. Why, I couldn&#8217;t keep a maid and hurl all that stuff
      at her every week!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Are they wearing hoops pretty generally?&#8221; Mrs. Morton
      inquired as Alice laughingly held a pair up for inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_98"></a>98</span>&#8220;Yes, and
      bustles too. See this buff poplin with the panniers just has to have a
      bustle. Thank goodness they&#8217;re young yet, as Dick says, but I
      suppose they&#8217;ll keep on getting bigger.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I should think they&#8217;d be so hot and horrid.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They are, but the hoops are delightfully cool, only you have to be
      on your guard with the treacherous things or they swing up in front when
      you sit down, in a most mortifying fashion.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I have a pair to wear with my muslin dresses&#8211;it makes them
      stand out beautifully,&#8221; said Katy complacently. &#8220;But Mother
      wouldn&#8217;t let Gertie have any. She said she was too young.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want the old things,&#8221; Gertie protested.
      &#8220;And you wouldn&#8217;t have got yours if you hadn&#8217;t teased
      perfectly awful, and I heard Mother say she guessed you&#8217;d soon be
      sick enough of them.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I agree entirely with your mother, Gertie, I consider them
      unsuitable for little girls. But they do set off a handsome dress to
      advantage. I remember during the war we used to wear such large ones we
      could hardly get through a door with them.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mother Morton, I bet you were a lot more frivolous than we are now.&#8221;
      Marian put her hand lovingly on the wrinkled one that was smoothing the
      folds of a rich silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton smiled. &#8220;Well, we had our pretty things. Alice&#8217;s
      dresses are lovely, but she hasn&#8217;t <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_99"></a>99</span>anything more elegant than my second day dress.
      It was a brown and silver silk brocade with thread lace chemisette and
      under sleeves. And my next best was apple green and pink changeable,
      trimmed in yards and yards of narrow black velvet ribbon all sewed on by
      hand.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;How I should love to have seen them!&#8221; Alice smiled wistfully.
      &#8220;You know I didn&#8217;t have any of my mother&#8217;s things.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Come on, girls, it&#8217;s getting late, let&#8217;s help Alice put
      her treasures away. They couldn&#8217;t be nicer, Alice, and I think you
      are going to be a very happy woman to make up for that desolate girlhood
      of yours.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian was already folding the garments. They were soon laid away snugly
      in trunk and closet and drawers, and the whole family packed off to bed to
      be ready for the early farm breakfast on the morrow.

    <h2>
      A HUNTING PARTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day following the arrival of the guests was spent in resting and
      seeing the ranch. Katy and Gertie had never been on a large farm before,
      and the thousand acres of field and prairie and woodland, seemed as
      marvellous as the tales they had read of the big English estates. Alice
      and Dick were also fascinated by all this space and freedom, but they saw
      deeper than the little girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a wonderful place,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t
      wonder the Doctor is proud of it. But he is too well along in years to
      handle such a big undertaking. I doubt if the ranch pays for ten years to
      come, and it means hard work and a lonely life for all of them. It&#8217;s
      all right for Frank and Marian, but I&#8217;m sorry for the rest of the
      family.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mrs. Morton is growing old fast with all this <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_101"></a>101</span>unaccustomed
      drudgery, and she is worried about the children&#8217;s education, I can
      see,&#8221; replied Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, there are two sides to it. I guess we&#8217;ll stick to the
      law and little old Centerville; we may not die rich, but we&#8217;ll be a
      lot more comfortable as we go along.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm took to the farm like the proverbial duck to the pond. He donned
      overalls that first morning and was off with Frank and Ernest to the
      fields before the little girls were out of bed. After breakfast Jane took
      Katie and Gertie to see the sights of the ranch. First to the spring under
      the old oak where the cold, clear water gushed from the rocks into a
      little basin, and then tumbled down a rocky channel under the springhouse
      and on for some hundred of yards farther before it widened out into the
      pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We can go swimming in the pond but there is a nicer place in the
      creek above the ford.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d love to learn to swim but we haven&#8217;t any
      bathing suits.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Pooh, that doesn&#8217;t matter, we just take some old dresses&#8211;there
      isn&#8217;t anybody to see you, especially down at the creek. You know it&#8217;s
      private ground and the trees hang over the pool all around so the sun only
      comes in a little bit. We&#8217;ll get Marian to go with us.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I should think you could skate, too.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_102"></a>102</span>&#8220;We do.
      I had a great time once last winter&#8211;Father told me the ice was too
      thin, but I saw a yearling calf go over all right and I thought the ice
      would bear me. But I guess calfie had more sense about the weak places. At
      any rate, I went through, near the middle. The water was up to my
      shoulders. Gee, it was cold and the ice kept breaking when I tried to
      climb out&#8211;and the men were all away. I most froze before I got to
      the bank, and then my skate straps were so wet I couldn&#8217;t loosen
      them, besides my fingers were too numb to bend. I had to walk on the
      skates all the way to the house. My teeth chattered till they almost
      played tunes by the time I got to the door.&#8221; Chicken Little shivered
      at the recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;s the cunning little stone house for?&#8221; Gertie&#8217;s
      attention was caught by a tiny hut without windows on the edge of the
      pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s the smokehouse. We&#8217;re so far from town that
      we put away a lot of meat every winter. The hams and sides of bacon are
      smoked there.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And that wooden building over yonder?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The granary&#8211;for the wheat and rye. Those open log houses are
      the corn cribs.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My, it takes a lot of buildings to make a ranch.&#8221; Katy was
      impressed in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We haven&#8217;t been to the barns and corrals yet. I love the hay
      mow.&#8221;

      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_103"></a>103</span>Chicken
      Little had not forgotten lumps of sugar for Calico and Caliph. Ernest had
      given his pony a high-sounding name. The intelligent beast was proud and
      dainty enough to deserve it. He was shy about coming for his lump, but
      when he once got the taste, he nosed around Chicken Little for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      They ended the morning&#8217;s wanderings in Jane&#8217;s own particular
      bower, known to the family as the Weeping Willows because she had once
      retired there to cry out her troubles, and had been discovered in a very
      moist state by Frank, who was a merciless tease.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two rows of the old willows. They formed a long leafy room on
      the edge of one of the orchards, out of sight both of the house and road.
      Chicken Little had been known to flee thither on more than one occasion
      when she did not wish to be disturbed in the thrilling place in a novel.
      For you really couldn&#8217;t hear any one calling from the house in this
      leafy fastness. Ernest had made her two or three rustic seats, and a
      little cupboard where she could keep her treasures sheltered from the sun
      and rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy and Gertie were charmed with this retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If there was only a table, I could write all my letters home out
      here. Wouldn&#8217;t it be romantic?&#8221; Katy loved the unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s lovely, Jane, let&#8217;s stay out here lots.&#8221;
      Gertie <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_104"></a>104</span>settled
      down on one of the seats with a little sigh. &#8220;I wish I had my old
      doll here; it would make such a dandy playhouse.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Gertie Halford, the idea of a great, big girl like you wanting to
      play with dolls.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I get Victoria out sometimes and dress her up,&#8221; confessed
      Jane. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t much fun all alone, but I like to see her
      sometimes. If you&#8217;d like to, Gertie, we&#8217;ll have a doll sewing
      bee this afternoon and you can be Victoria&#8217;s mother and Katie and I
      will be dressmaker&#8217;s though I never could sew decently. Mother&#8217;s
      about given me up in despair.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little had noticed a little far-away look in Gertie&#8217;s eyes
      ever since she came. Marian had warned her the night before that she had
      better keep Gertie pretty busy for a day or two, or she would be homesick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, Chicken Little&#8217;s kindness precipitated the
      catastrophe she was trying to avoid. She was so motherly she reminded
      Gertie afresh of the dear little mother she had left so many miles behind
      and the tears came in spite of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little coaxed and comforted, and Katy coaxed and scolded, but
      Gertie&#8217;s tears were apparently turned on for keeps and the Weeping
      Willows was earning its name again. Gertie cried till she got all shivery,
      declaring solemnly whenever she could command her voice sufficiently to
      talk, that <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_105"></a>105</span>there
      wasn&#8217;t a thing the matter&#8211;only&#8211;only&#8211;she&#8211;was
      a little bit homesick.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wouldn&#8217;t hear to Jane&#8217;s going to fetch Alice or Mrs.
      Morton or Marian. &#8220;She&#8217;d be all right in a minute, if they&#8217;d
      just let her alone.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the minutes went by and she still cried, and in spite of the warm June
      sunshine, her hands felt cold and her shoulders shook as if with an ague.
      Chicken Little and Katy were both getting worried when help came in the
      shape of Marian and Jilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian understood at a glance, and dropping to the ground beside her, drew
      her into her lap and chafed the cold hands while she bade Jilly hug poor
      Gertie. Jilly was a born comforter and she half smothered the patient with
      her energetic hugs and moist, warm kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Too bad, too bad&#8211;ants bite Gertie, too bad! Jilly fine
      &#8217;em.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jilly had not forgotten her own sad experience with the ants and not
      seeing any visible cause for Gertie&#8217;s woes, evidently thought they
      were the guilty ones again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jilly was irresistible. Gertie had to laugh, even if the tears running
      down her face, did leave a salty taste in her mouth. She hugged the small
      comforter. Jilly, however, was not to be turned from her hunt. She
      insisted upon pulling down Gertie&#8217;s stockings and making a minute
      search for the culprits. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_106"></a>106</span>Her
      little tickling fingers and earnest air completed Gertie&#8217;s cure, and
      Jilly adopted her as her own particular property from that day on, seeming
      to consider her in need of protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian declared they must all come and have dinner with her. Ernest and
      Sherm were already there and they had a merry meal in the little cottage,
      for Marian made them all help&#8211;even the big boys. She tied a blue
      apron around Sherm and set him to stirring gravy while Ernest watched four
      cherry pies almost ready to come out of the oven. She had despatched Katy
      and Jane to the springhouse after milk and butter. Gertie, assisted by
      Jilly, set the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm had burned a nice fiery red during his morning&#8217;s plowing. He
      was immensely proud of his efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I tell you Sherm&#8217;s some farmer for a tenderfoot,&#8221; said
      Ernest, telling about the number of corn rows he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Better come stay with us, Sherm.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Haven&#8217;t I come&#8211;I love the ranch. But I suppose I&#8217;ve
      got four years of college ahead of me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;ll have time enough after that, Sherm,&#8221; said Frank,
      &#8220;but if you should want to try ranching, you&#8217;d better come out
      this way.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No ranching for me.&#8221; Ernest thumped the table with his fork
      emphatically. &#8220;You can have my <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_107"></a>107</span>berth, Sherm, and welcome. The only thing I
      care for here, is the hunting. By the way, Frank, are you and Marian going
      hunting with us?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;d like to. What do you say, Marian?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, if there&#8217;s room for so many.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I wish we could ask Captain Clarke,&#8221; Chicken Little spoke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My, you are daffy about the Captain, Jane. He wouldn&#8217;t go&#8211;you
      couldn&#8217;t hire him to if he knew Alice and I were to be of the party.
      Queer he is so charming with Jane, and with the men and boys, and so very
      reserved and stiff with women.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He probably has some reason for disliking your sex. Perhaps, if we&#8217;d
      let him go with the children and the boys, he might be persuaded to come.
      He&#8217;d only see you at luncheon time. What&#8217;s the matter, Katie?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m not a child,&#8221; said Katy with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;All right, you may come with us grown-ups and let the Captain have
      the children and the boys.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;d better find out whether the Captain is willing before
      you plan so definitely, Frank.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We&#8217;ll send Chicken Little and Sherm over on the ponies as a
      special deputation to invite him. You must coax your prettiest, Sis.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;d love to. I just know I can get him to come. Will you go
      with me, Sherm?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_108"></a>108</span>&#8220;Nothing
      I&#8217;d like better,&#8221; responded Sherm heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next few days fairly twinkled by. The girls roamed the woods and the
      fields with Dick and Alice, and went in bathing, and fed chickens, and
      even made little pats of butter down in the cool springhouse. Gertie
      mourned because she could not send hers home straightway to Mother.
      Chicken Little and Sherm waited until Sunday to go over to the Captain&#8217;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm found Caliph and the Mexican saddle rather more to his taste than
      Chicken Little&#8217;s outfit had been on the ride from town. He had about
      all he could do for the first five minutes to manage Caliph for he had had
      little opportunity for riding at home. But he had a cool head, and with a
      few suggestions from Jane, he soon convinced Caliph that he had a new
      master as determined as Ernest, if not quite so skilful a horseman. They
      did not talk much. Sherm considered Jane a little girl and Jane stood
      rather in awe of Sherm. But they enjoyed the brisk ride none the less. The
      swift motion with the wind in their faces, the wide stretches of prairie
      bounded on the distant horizon by a faint line of timber, were novel and
      delightful to Sherm. To Jane, they were familiar and dearly loved.
      Besides, she liked having Sherm with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her from time to time. Chicken <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_109"></a>109</span>Little glanced back with sweet, friendly eyes.
      It was she who finally broke the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I do hope the Captain will go. I&#8217;m most sure he&#8217;ll like
      you, because his little boy looked a lot like you. He showed me the
      picture.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He seems to like you all right from what they say.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little laughed merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm couldn&#8217;t quite see the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s so funny about that?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Will you cross your heart never to tell, Sherm? Frank and Ernest
      would tease the life out of me if they knew.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Cut my heart out and eat it, if I ever breathe a word.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little related the swearing episode which she had not seen fit to
      trouble even Marian with, at home. &#8220;I guess,&#8221; she concluded,
      &#8220;he felt sort of sorry for me right at the start and that made him
      like me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;&#8217;Twouldn&#8217;t be such a hard job as you seem to think,
      Jane,&#8221; Sherm surprised himself by saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little flushed and looked up hastily at Sherm who also felt his
      face getting warm to his great disgust. Sherm hated softies of any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I believe there&#8217;s the Captain now over by the pasture
      fence.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke was riding round the pastures inspecting <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_110"></a>110</span>the barbed wire
      fencing. He soon hailed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Hello, Little Neighbor, is the piebald behaving himself?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane introduced Sherm as soon as they came abreast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Captain Clarke, this is Ernest&#8217;s friend, the Sherman Dart I
      told you about.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke scanned the boy&#8217;s face curiously. His own went a
      little white after an instant&#8217;s inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You are right&#8211;he is marvellously like what my boy might be
      to-day. I beg your pardon for my rude scrutiny. Possibly Jane has told you
      of the resemblance. You will come up to the house and let Wing give you
      some lemonade. It is hot this afternoon.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little declined to take him from his course and told him their
      errand. He hesitated. &#8220;You say Mr. and Mrs. Harding and your brother
      and his wife are going. Would you think me very rude and unappreciative if
      I declined, dear? I am poor company for anyone these days and&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little looked so disappointed that he paused ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Please, just this once, Katie and Gertie want to see you dreadfully
      and you could go with us. Pretty please.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_111"></a>111</span>She thought
      she saw signs of weakening. Sherm also noticed the Captain&#8217;s
      hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We&#8217;ve all sort of set our hearts on having you, Sir. Chicken
      Little and Ernest have talked so much about you we feel acquainted, and
      Dr. Morton says you&#8217;re a dead shot. I&#8217;ve never hunted anything
      but squirrels myself.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke stared at Sherm as if in a dream for a minute. The boy was
      embarrassed by his silence and smiled his little crooked smile to cover
      it. Their host passed his hand over his eyes and sighed. Then he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s no disgrace to surrender to a superior force. I am yours
      to command. But I stipulate that you two stand by me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little gave a bounce in her saddle to emphasize her delight and
      Calico took this as a hint to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Whoa, Calico! Thank you&#8211;bushels! Oh, I just know we&#8217;ll
      have the best time! Would you mind if we children all went with you
      because nobody&#8217;s going to be willing to be left out?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I can take five nicely and have plenty of room for guns and lunch
      baskets besides. By the way, please tell your mother that Wing Fan will
      never forgive me if he is not permitted to get up the lunch for all the
      young people at the very least.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_112"></a>112</span>&#8220;Have
      you a gun with you?&#8221; he asked Sherm as they were going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, but Ernest said I might take his.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I have a new shotgun. I should be glad if you would share it with
      me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Alice and Dick, Marian, Katie, Gertie and Jilly, not to mention
      Huz and Buz, waiting for them on the Morton side of the ford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What luck?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm didn&#8217;t give Jane a chance to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, Chicken Little just put on her company smile and the Captain
      held out his hands and said: &#8216;Handcuffs, please.&#8217;&#8221; He
      was meeker than Buz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherman Dart, you old&#8211;&#8221; Chicken Little flicked Caliph
      lightly by way of revenge, and Sherm had his hands full for several
      seconds, for Caliph resented the indignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was arranged to start early the following Saturday morning. Mrs. Morton
      and Annie were up soon after daylight busy with the mysteries of fried
      chicken and fresh rolls. The men of the party were equally busy cleaning
      guns and routing out all sorts of hunting toggery. The girls tried to help
      everybody impartially, succeeding for the most part in making a general
      nuisance of themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      At exactly seven-thirty Captain Clarke drove up with a wonderful team of
      blacks. His hunting jacket was belted in with a formidable looking <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_113"></a>113</span>cartridge belt, two
      shotguns were slid in on the floor of the spring wagon, and lunch baskets
      and a great earthenware jug of lemonade were wedged in under the seats. He
      gave a shrill hunting halloo as he drew up at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton was a little disturbed at the gay looking team.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Are you quite sure they are safe with the guns? You know young
      people are often reckless and this is a very precious load.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My dear madam, I think I can answer for Jim and Jerry. I took them
      out for an hour yesterday and used the gun over their heads to make sure
      they hadn&#8217;t forgotten their manners.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain met the strangers of the party in his usual courteous reserved
      fashion, but his eyes lighted when Chicken Little ran down the walk. He
      established Ernest and Katie and Gertie on the back seat and swung Jane up
      in front to the driver&#8217;s seat with Sherm on her left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ernest, I&#8217;ll handle the ribbons going, if it suits you, and
      you can drive us back. I have an idea you will have the sharpest eye for
      game of any of this crowd. We ought to do our best work the next two hours
      for snipe. We probably won&#8217;t find many prairie chickens until we get
      over on Little John. By the way, boys, be careful not to disturb the
      mother birds&#8211;there are still some on the nests. I <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_114"></a>114</span>really don&#8217;t
      like to hunt quite so early in the season as this, although a good many of
      the young birds are shifting for themselves already&#8211;bird parents
      have a beautiful faith in Providence. They don&#8217;t worry long about
      their young.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A light shower had fallen the night before and the air was fresh and
      fragrant with the smell of wet grasses and moist earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rattle of wheels close behind assured them that Frank and his load
      were near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Kansas certainly takes the cake for climate,&#8221; Dick called to
      them, happily reckless about corrupting the young folk with his slang.
      Alice promptly reproached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mrs. Morton would send you home by the first train if she heard
      you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick assumed an air of mock woe. &#8220;Oh, I say there, Chicken Little,
      don&#8217;t mention that little matter of the cake&#8211;that particular
      cake isn&#8217;t respectable, Alice says.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Frank who got the first shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Here, Marian, take the lines quick. Hold them tight&#8211;they may
      jump when I fire. Turn out of the road&#8211;to the right&#8211;slowly
      now. Stop!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank drew the gun to his shoulder and took careful aim while the others
      were still vainly trying to see something to shoot at. A snap, a flash,
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_115"></a>115</span>and a bird
      whirred up a hundred paces away, flew a few feet from the ground, and
      fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank ran to the spot and held up a good-sized plover. Marian and Alice
      examined it pitifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What a slender delicate thing it is! It seems a shame to kill it. I
      like the excitement of hunting but I always want to cry over the victims,&#8221;
      said Alice with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm caught sight of a covey soon after. He and Ernest slipped out of the
      wagon and stole up as close as possible. Ernest got two with the
      scattering bird shot, but Sherm missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You were too anxious, lad. Stop an instant always before you fire
      to make sure your hand is steady,&#8221; the Captain consoled him kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm profited by this advice and brought down his next bird. Captain
      Clarke left the game to the boys until their first zest for the sport was
      satisfied. Chicken Little frequently discovered the birds before either of
      the boys, and was eager to have a turn herself, as was also Katy. Gertie
      put her hands to her ears every time a gun was fired and openly hoped they
      wouldn&#8217;t find any more game to shoot at. Captain Clarke advised the
      girls to wait a little, and watch the boys carefully to see exactly how
      they aimed and rested their guns, and he would help them both a little
      later. But Ernest soon undertook Katie&#8217;s education and was surprised
      to find <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_116"></a>116</span>he
      had a very apt pupil. Katy had as steady a nerve and as true an eye as
      either of the boys. Ernest began to be alarmed lest his pupil win his
      honors away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You must have shot before, Katy.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I have with a revolver. Uncle Sim used to let me shoot at a target.
      And he had an archery club last summer.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain did his best for Chicken Little but she did not do nearly so
      well as Katy, though she made one shot the Captain considered quite
      extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty long range for a novice, little neighbor, but
      you can try it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two birds flew up where she had seen one. &#8220;Oh, dear, I missed,&#8221;
      she lamented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure,&#8221; said Sherm. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go
      see.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped her down and they made a brisk run toward the spot where the
      grouse had risen. After a few minutes, Sherm stooped and picked up a bird
      considerably to the right of where Chicken Little had aimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be jiggered!&#8221; he exclaimed with a puzzled
      expression. &#8220;You did get one.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood looking down thoughtfully at the ground. Chicken Little hurried
      to him elated, but her joy was short-lived. Snuggled among the grasses was
      an empty nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_117"></a>117</span>&#8220;Oh, do
      you &#8217;spose she was on the nest? But I couldn&#8217;t have seen her
      if she had been&#8211;and it&#8217;s empty.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of reply, Sherm stooped again and picked up a baby grouse from a
      clump of weeds. Fear had frozen it into a motionless wee brown image.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, the poor little darling! I took its mother.&#8221; Chicken
      Little looked ready to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bending down Sherm parted the weeds and grasses cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Here&#8217;s another&#8211;and another. We must hunt them, Chicken
      Little, and take them home or they will all starve. Gee, what can we put
      them in?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane slipped her hat elastic from under her braid, and taking a handful of
      long grass to line it with, soon made a snug nest. They tucked the mottled
      downy bunches into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What in Sam Hill are you people doing over there?&#8221; called
      Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Little grouse&#8211;come help us find them,&#8221; Sherm called
      back. &#8220;Be careful now or you&#8217;ll step on them,&#8221; he warned
      as Ernest and the girls came running up. &#8220;They are the slyest little
      codgers&#8211;you don&#8217;t see them until you are right on them.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertie was on her knees peering before the words were out of his mouth.
      She lifted a fourth mite from its hiding place, and a fifth, and a sixth,
      almost as fast as she could pick them up. &#8220;Oh, aren&#8217;t they
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_118"></a>118</span>dear? May I
      hold them, Jane, when we get back to the wagon?&#8221; Gertie was
      caressing them with hands and eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were ten chicks cuddled in the hat, when after a thorough search of
      the weeds, Ernest announced that they must surely have them all. But to
      make sure they went over the ground in all directions once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane was very sober. Sherm tried to cheer her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t help it, Chicken Little. You didn&#8217;t mean
      to.&#8221; Sherm smiled his funny smile as he said this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why are you smiling? Oh, I know&#8211;I believe so, too.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What secrets are you talking?&#8221; Katy was curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, speak United States, it isn&#8217;t polite to leave your
      guests in the dark this way,&#8221; growled Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane haughtily declined to explain just then. When they returned to the
      wagon, they found the Captain as much interested in the shot, as he was in
      the prairie chicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That was really a wonderful hit, little girl. I congratulate you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane stole a glance at Sherm. He wasn&#8217;t looking at her, but he was
      smiling. Jane smiled, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Captain Clarke,&#8221; she replied demurely, &#8220;it was
      rather astonishing.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_119"></a>119</span>This was too
      much for Sherm who chuckled openly. Captain Clarke looked from one to the
      other inquiringly. The others were completely mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, I&#8217;d just like to know what you two are up to.&#8221;
      Katy wrinkled her nose in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Can&#8217;t a fellow laugh without having to give an account of
      himself?&#8221; Sherm parried, still trying to stave off the mirth that
      possessed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little&#8217;s face was sweetly sober. &#8220;He&#8217;s
      appreciating my&#8211;skill&#8211;the rest of you don&#8217;t seem to
      realize what a feat&#8212;&#8221; A sound, something between a crow and a
      suppressed steam whistle interrupted her. Sherm whooped until he was red
      in the face. Chicken Little regarded him reproachfully, but continued:
      &#8220;You see most anybody can hit the chicken they aim at, but it takes
      a fine shot to hit one you didn&#8217;t know was there.&#8221; She grinned
      mischievously up at the Captain who grinned back delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Really, Chicken Little?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Really.&#8221; She joined in the general laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What did you want to tell for?&#8221; Sherm had enjoyed having the
      joke to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She didn&#8217;t answer then, but later she whispered: &#8220;Because the
      Captain&#8211;I didn&#8217;t want him praising me that way!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Noon found them fifteen miles from home with <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_120"></a>120</span>a bag of six snipe and ten prairie chickens,
      and appetites that fairly clamored. Frank found an ideal camping place in
      a grove of walnut trees beside a small creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I camped here once two years ago and there&#8217;s a fine spring
      somewhere near. Come along, Katie, we&#8217;ll go hunt it. Ernest, picket
      the horses&#8211;there&#8217;s oats under the back seat. And Sherm, if you&#8217;ll
      just start a fire for the coffee.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian and Alice spread the luncheon out on a long tablecloth laid over
      the dust robes on the ground. Gertie and Chicken Little fed the little
      grouse with some moistened bread crumbs, finding it difficult at first to
      induce them to eat. But they would swallow, when the girls pried open
      their tiny beaks and stuck a crumb inside. Captain Clarke showed them how,
      and patiently helped them until each tiny craw was at least partly filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian and Alice watched him furtively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He is gentle as a woman,&#8221; Alice whispered, &#8220;and his
      face lights up wonderfully when he smiles, though it is stern usually.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I can see now why Jane is so fascinated. Do you know his smile
      is very much like Sherm&#8217;s? See&#8211;no, just wait a minute. Now&#8211;watch
      his upper lip&#8211;his mouth twists crooked exactly like Sherm&#8217;s.
      Chicken Little spoke of his baby&#8217;s picture having the same smile.&#8221;
      Marian dropped her <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_121"></a>121</span>eyes
      hastily as the Captain chanced to turn in their direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I imagine lots of people have that kind of a smile only we never
      noticed them,&#8221; replied Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Of course, I didn&#8217;t mean to suggest anything. Will you cut
      the lemon cake?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      After the luncheon was eaten, the shady grove tempted them to linger on
      with its woodsy coolness. The younger folk dragging the Captain, a willing
      victim, along with them, went off on an exploring expedition while the
      others stretched out luxuriously on the coarse grass that grew rank along
      the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was four o&#8217;clock before they could tear themselves away for the
      homeward ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;d better hurry,&#8221; Frank called to the stragglers,
      &#8220;it will be almost dark before we get home even if we don&#8217;t
      stop to shoot.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They picked up a few quail on the divide soon after they started, but
      their zest for the sport seemed to have waned. Chicken Little declined to
      try any further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know, it&#8217;s the baby grouse,&#8221; said Katy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Captain Clarke, &#8220;I think the baby grouse
      have rather taken the zip out of it for all of us.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was just peeping above the tree tops as they crossed the home
      ford. A huge grotesque shadow of the horses and wagon with its load, was
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_122"></a>122</span>reflected
      upon the silvered surface of a deep pool just beyond the ripples where
      they had stopped to let the horses drink. The blacks having satisfied
      their thirst, began to dash the water about with their hoofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They love it, don&#8217;t they?&#8221; Katy watched them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Captain thoughtfully, &#8220;I guess every
      living thing enjoys this beautiful world of ours&#8211;when it is given
      the chance.&#8221;

    <h2>
      PIGS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &#8220;Take a hand to a wooster? Take a hand to a wooster!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick Harding was standing out in the road near the white cottage one
      morning about two weeks after the hunting party, trying to decide whether
      he would take a walk or a ride to settle his breakfast. He glanced down
      into Jilly&#8217;s sober little face lifted to his appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Take a hand to a wooster? Charmed, I&#8217;m sure. Point out the
      rooster. But what has his rooster-ship done, and how can I make him keep
      still long enough to lay hands on him, Jilly Dilly?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jilly clasped five fat fingers around two of his, smiled confidingly and
      made her plea once more: &#8220;Take a hand to a wooster.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_124"></a>124</span>Dick looked
      puzzled, but Jilly was pulling and he meekly followed her guidance.
      &#8220;I haven&#8217;t the faintest idea what you are getting me into,
      young lady, but go ahead, I&#8217;m at your service.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jilly pattered along not deigning to reply to his remarks. Jilly
      considered words as something to be reserved for business purposes only.
    </p>
    <p>
      She led him to the chicken yard, pressed her small face against the wire
      netting that enclosed it, and contemplated the fowls ecstatically. Dick
      contemplated also, trying to pick out the offending rooster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Which rooster, Jilly?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jilly only smiled vaguely. &#8220;Feed a wooster,&#8221; she commanded
      after another season of gazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, to be sure, but what would you suggest that I offer him? There
      doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything edible round here.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The chickens seconded Jilly&#8217;s suggestion, coming to the fence and
      clucking excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jilly looked pained at Dick&#8217;s indolence and, taking his hand, led
      him over to a covered wooden box, which was found to contain shelled corn.
      The chickens were duly fed, but Dick still puzzled over the unchastized
      rooster until Marian enlightened him later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I shall have to give you a key to Jilly&#8217;s dialect,&#8221;
      Marian laughed&#8211;&#8220;she merely wanted you to go with her to see
      the chickens.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_125"></a>125</span>Chicken
      Little was enjoying her guests. Her resolve to help mother was carried out
      only semi-occasionally when there were raspberries or currants to be
      picked or peas to be shelled, under the grape arbor so they wouldn&#8217;t
      be in Annie&#8217;s way in the kitchen. At first, Mrs. Morton had counted
      on having the girls help with the breakfast dishes, but they developed
      such a genius for disappearing immediately after breakfast that she gave
      it up as more bother than it was worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tramped and rode, and waded and splashed and finally swam, in the
      bathing hole down at the creek, under Marian&#8217;s or Alice&#8217;s
      supervision, till Katie and Gertie were brown and hearty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mrs. Halford wouldn&#8217;t know Gertie&#8211;she&#8217;s fairly
      made over,&#8221; Alice observed one morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertie was fast losing her timidity and had so much persistence in
      learning to ride that she bade fair to have a more graceful seat in the
      saddle than Jane herself. Sherm was deep in farm work and the girls saw
      little either of him or of Ernest, except in the evenings and on Sundays.
      Dick ran the reaper in the harvest field for Dr. Morton for three days,
      but his zeal waned as the weather got hotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;This is my vacation and I don&#8217;t want to sweat my sweet self
      entirely away &#8216;in little drops of water.&#8217; Think how pained you&#8217;d
      be, dearest,&#8221; he told Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I never dreamed there was so much farming to <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_126"></a>126</span>a ranch,&#8221;
      Alice remarked to Dr. Morton one day. &#8220;I thought you attended to the
      cattle&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And rode around in chaps and sombreros, looking picturesque, the
      rest of the time,&#8221; interrupted Dick. &#8220;My precious wife is
      disappointed because she hasn&#8217;t seen any cowboys cavorting about the
      place shooting each other up or gambling with nice picturesque bags of
      gold dust.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Dick Harding! I didn&#8217;t. But we&#8217;d hardly know there were
      any cattle round if we didn&#8217;t go through the pasture occasionally.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Our big pastures take them off our hands pretty well in summer, but
      in winter they have to be fed and herded and looked after generally, don&#8217;t
      they, Chicken Little? Humbug has played herd boy herself more than once.
      You are thinking of the big cattle ranges in Colorado and Montana and
      Wyoming, Alice. This country is cut up into farms and the ranges are gone.
      And we have to raise our corn and wheat and rye, not to mention fruits and
      vegetables. It&#8217;s a busy life, but I love its independence.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two after this conversation, Ernest came in late to dinner,
      exclaiming: &#8220;Father, the white sow and all her thirteen pigs are
      out.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The Dickens, have you any idea where she&#8217;s gone?&#8221; Dr.
      Morton looked decidedly annoyed. &#8220;I told Jim Bart that pen wasn&#8217;t
      strong enough to hold her&#8211;she&#8217;s the meanest animal on the
      place.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_127"></a>127</span>&#8220;One of
      the harvest hands said he thought he saw her down along the slough. I am
      sorry for the porkers if she is&#8211;they aren&#8217;t a week old yet.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Go down right after dinner and see if you can see anything of her.
      The old fool will lose them all in that marshy ground. And I don&#8217;t
      see how we can spare a man to look after them. It looks like rain and that
      wheat must be in the barns by night.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest came back from his search to report that the sow and one lone pig
      had wandered back to the barnyard and Jim Bart had got them into the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;One pig! You don&#8217;t mean she has lost the other twelve? That&#8217;s
      costly business!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Looks that way. They&#8217;re such little fellows&#8211;I suppose
      they&#8217;re squealing down there in the slough in that swamp grass&#8211;it&#8217;s
      a regular jungle three or four feet high.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton studied a moment, perplexed. &#8220;Well, the grain is worth
      more than the pigs. I guess they&#8217;ll have to go until evening and
      then we&#8217;ll all go down and see how many we can find. They won&#8217;t
      suffer greatly before night unless they find enough water to drown
      themselves in.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, the poor piggies!&#8221; exclaimed Chicken Little. &#8220;Why,
      they&#8217;ll be most starved and maybe the bull snakes might get them.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I hardly think they could manage a pig. But I can&#8217;t help it,
      unless you think you could rescue them, <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_128"></a>128</span>daughter.&#8221; Dr. Morton said this last in
      fun, but Chicken Little took it seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What could I put them in, Father?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, you might take a small chicken coop,&#8221; replied her father
      carelessly. The wagons coming from the barn were already rattling into the
      road and he was in a hurry to catch one and save himself the hot walk to
      the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was thinking. She sat twisting a corner of her apron into a
      tight roll. &#8220;I believe we could do it,&#8221; she said presently,
      &#8220;and the bull snakes are perfectly harmless if they are big,
      ugly-looking things. Will you help me, Katie?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ugh, are there really snakes there, Jane?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, but we&#8217;ve never seen any poisonous ones along there,
      though I saw a water moccasin once right down by the spring, so you never
      can tell. But snakes sound a lot worse than they really are, &#8217;cause
      they&#8217;re such cowards they always run.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy considered. The task did not sound attractive, but Katy was plucky.
      &#8220;I guess, if you can do it, I can.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane had not thought of asking Gertie and she was surprised to hear her
      say: &#8220;I&#8217;m coming, too.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, Gertie, won&#8217;t you be afraid?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m afraid, but I don&#8217;t want the little piggies
      killed&#8211;just think how you&#8217;d feel if you were lost in such a
      dreadful place and there were snakes <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_129"></a>129</span>and awful things. If I see a snake I&#8217;ll
      yell bloody murder, and I guess it&#8217;ll let me alone.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane threw herself on Gertie and hugged her. &#8220;Gertie Halford, I
      think you&#8217;d make a real, sure enough book heroine, because you do
      things when you think you ought to, whether you&#8217;re scared or not.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I wish Dick hadn&#8217;t gone to town to-day,&#8221; said Katy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little had her campaign already planned. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
      get Ernest&#8217;s and Frank&#8217;s and Sherm&#8217;s rubber boots for
      us. They&#8217;ll be lots too big, but we can tie them around the legs to
      make them stick on. They will be fine in the mud and water if we have to
      wade in the slough. Yes, and they will protect us from the snakes, too. We
      won&#8217;t put them on till we get down there; they will be too hard to
      walk in. And we can take Jilly&#8217;s red wagon and put the smallest
      chicken coop on it. It isn&#8217;t heavy.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton had gone to town with Dick and Alice for the day or the girls
      would probably not have been permitted to carry out their unusual
      undertaking. They quickly made their preparations with much joking about
      the boots, and twenty minutes later came to the banks of the slough. The
      slough was in reality a continuation of the spring stream, which spread
      out in the meadows below the pond until it lost all semblance of a stream
      and became <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_130"></a>130</span>merely
      a marshy stretch, whose waters finally found their way into the creek. In
      the meadows adjoining, the finest hay on the place was cut each year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls sat down on the grass and fastened on the boots. The effect was
      somewhat startling, for they reached well above the knee on Chicken
      Little, who was the tallest of the three, while poor Gertie seemed to be
      divided into two equal parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Katy and Jane giggled when she got laboriously to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There&#8217;s more boots than girl, Gertie,&#8221; laughed Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to be afraid, Sis, you&#8217;ll scare
      anything, even a snake!&#8221; Katy remarked unfeelingly, though her words
      reassured Gertie wonderfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel so afraid in these,&#8221; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was slowly making her way in to the slough. &#8220;Jim
      found the mother pig near here, Ernest said, but the little scamps may be
      most anywhere. Let&#8217;s listen and see if we can hear any squeals or
      grunts.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I did&#8211;I&#8217;m most sure, but it didn&#8217;t sound
      very close by,&#8221; Gertie answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little listened. &#8220;Which way did the sound come from?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Toward the creek, but I don&#8217;t hear it any more.&#8221;
    </p>
    <div class="figcenter">
      <img src="images/p0130-insert.jpg" id="img018" alt="" />
      <p class="center caption">
        They had a pretty chase.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_131"></a>131</span>&#8220;We&#8217;d
      better search pretty carefully as we go along so we won&#8217;t have to
      come back over the same ground,&#8221; remarked Katy, who had a genius for
      organizing&#8211;even a pig hunt. &#8220;You are the tallest, Jane, so you
      take the tallest grass next the water, and I&#8217;ll come along half way
      up the bank and Gertie can walk through the meadow grass&#8211;that way we
      can&#8217;t miss them.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, for they must be on this side of the slough: they&#8217;re too
      little to wade across it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little made the first find, two discouraged little porkers,
      hopelessly mired and grunting feebly when disturbed. They had no trouble
      in catching these, but holding their wet, miry little bodies was a
      different matter. They were slippery as eels. Chicken Little and Katy, who
      each had one, found them a handful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, mine most got away! And I&#8217;m all over mud&#8211;we&#8217;ll
      be a sight!&#8221; Katy giggled hysterically. &#8220;I wonder what mother
      would think if she could see me now.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, it will all wash off. It wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if it wasn&#8217;t
      so hard to clump along in these old boots. It takes forever to get any
      place.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They had sent Gertie on ahead to open the coop door. With a sigh of
      relief, Katy shoved hers into it. Jane was not so lucky. Instead of going
      in, as a well-regulated pig should, the small, black-and-white sinner shot
      off to one side and made for the slough again. They had a pretty chase
      before he <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_132"></a>132</span>finally
      tangled himself up in the grass and was captured once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      They plodded back to take up the search where they had left off, going
      through the shorter grass till they should reach the point where they had
      found the pigs. They were clumping along, chattering gaily, when Katy
      jumped and let out a yell that could have been heard a block away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s the biggest snake I ever saw&#8211;over there
      near that rock&#8211;don&#8217;t you see?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertie turned white, but Chicken Little encouraged her by starting toward
      the monster, which was indeed a huge bull snake fully five feet long, as
      Ernest and Sherm found by actual measurement that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Pooh,&#8221; said Chicken Little, &#8220;it looks dreadful, but it
      won&#8217;t hurt you. If I can find some stones I&#8217;m going to try to
      kill it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare go near it.&#8221; Katy grabbed her dress and
      held on tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But we&#8217;ll all be scared to death all the time, for fear we
      come across it again, if I don&#8217;t. There are some rocks over there
      big enough, if I can get them out of the ground.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She went resolutely over and, prying with a stick, secured two good-sized
      rocks. Armed with these, she started toward the snake coiled up asleep in
      the hot July sunshine. Katy and Gertie watched her <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_133"></a>133</span>breathlessly.
      Chicken Little advanced with caution. She didn&#8217;t like the job
      herself, though she was sure the snake wouldn&#8217;t do anything worse
      than run. She had seen her elders kill them more than once, and they had
      always been cowardly. Nevertheless, her heart thumped and her breath came
      fast, as she crept nearer. She must go close and aim at the head if she
      hoped to do any execution. Step by step she crept forward till she was
      within four feet of that ugly coil. Stopping, she raised the heavy stone
      and took careful aim. At this instant her presence disturbed the snake. It
      raised its oval head, fixing her with its beady, bright eyes. A thrill of
      horror shot through her. What if it should fascinate her so she couldn&#8217;t
      move? She had heard of such things. She heaved the stone, shutting her
      eyes tight as it left her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy and Gertie both screamed and jumped back. Jane opened her eyes
      quickly to see the snake uncoil and start to glide away. She saw something
      else, too. She saw that her stone had wounded it just behind the head. Her
      courage flowed back in a trice. She raised the other stone and moved
      forward. The snake was slipping over the ground at a swift pace. She had
      to run, catching up with it as it came to its hole, a few feet distant.
      She smashed down the second rock almost in the same place she had hit
      before. The reptile moved feebly about six inches <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_134"></a>134</span>farther till its
      ugly head was hidden inside the hole, then thrashed its heavy body through
      another undulation, and lay still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little stood looking at it in dazed surprise for several seconds.
      She was white and trembling with excitement. Seeing that it did not move,
      Katy and Gertie crept a little closer. No one said a word for a full
      minute, then Chicken Little came to life, her face convulsed with
      loathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ugh, the nasty thing&#8211;I hate them. I don&#8217;t see what God
      wanted to make such horrid, wicked things for!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, the Bible says they weren&#8217;t wicked till Eve ate the
      apple,&#8221; Katy replied, staring curiously down at the snake. She had
      never seen such a big one outside of a circus. &#8220;But I think they
      must have always looked wicked, anyhow. How did you ever dare, Chicken
      Little, to tackle it? I was expecting it to wind right round you like that
      picture of Laocoon in our mythology.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have dared if I hadn&#8217;t seen so many of them
      before. I guess being brave is mostly being used to things. But I hate
      snakes worse than anything in the world&#8211;I don&#8217;t feel a bit
      sorry about killing them!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; said Gertie, shuddering, &#8220;I s&#8217;pose we
      have got to find the rest of the pigs.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_135"></a>135</span>Katy and
      Chicken Little each echoed the sigh. They all started ahead resolutely.
      But they kept closer together for a time. They went some little distance
      without finding any further signs of the lost animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose we could have passed them, do you?&#8221;
      Katy inquired anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t, if they are on this side of the slough.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few rods farther on something moved in the swamp grass. All three jumped
      and screamed: their nerve had been sadly weakened by the bull snake.
    </p>
    <p>
      A squeal and chorus of grunts reassured them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Here they are&#8211;a lot of them. Oh, dear, I wish we&#8217;d
      brought the coop along so we wouldn&#8217;t have to go back.&#8221; Jane
      parted the tall grass and discovered five of the fugitives huddled
      together. They were much livelier than the first ones and showed symptoms
      of bolting if the girls approached nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll go back for it,&#8221; said Katy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go
      through the short grass and I won&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little and Gertie watched and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that little white one with the pink ears and curly tail
      cunning? I didn&#8217;t suppose pigs could be so pretty.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They are only pretty when they are weenties. As soon as they grow
      old enough to root in the mud, they are horrid.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_136"></a>136</span>When Katy
      returned they anchored the red wagon with the chicken coop and the two
      captured piglets as close to the slough as possible. All three crept upon
      the pig cache cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Pick out which one you&#8217;ll grab, for they are going to run
      sure,&#8221; Chicken Little admonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made a dash and each got a pig, but, alas, the two free ones made a
      dash also&#8211;a break for liberty worthy of an Indian. They selected
      routes immediately in front of, and immediately behind Chicken Little,
      whose attention was absorbed with trying to hold a squealing, squirming
      pig. The result was disastrous to all concerned. Pig No. 1 tripped her up
      neatly and she sat down hastily and unexpectedly upon Pig No. 2, who gave
      one agonized squeal, in which the pig in her arms joined. Fortunately, her
      victim did not get her whole weight or there would have been one pig the
      less in this vale of tears. Chicken Little squashed him down gently into
      some two inches of oozy mud and water. It splashed in all directions,
      baptizing Katy and Gertie and the fleeing pig as well as completing the
      ruin of Jane&#8217;s pink gingham frock, fresh that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of her amazed and disgusted face generously decorated with mud,
      was too much for Katy. She giggled till the tears stood in her eyes.
      Chicken Little was indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_137"></a>137</span>&#8220;I
      guess you wouldn&#8217;t think it was so funny, if it was you,&#8221; she
      replied with dignity. Dignity did not become her tout ensemble. Katy went
      off into fresh screams of mirth. Chicken Little had stood about all she
      could that afternoon. Her face flamed with wrath, and, gathering up the
      struggling pig in her arms, she hurled it at Katy, as the only missile
      within reach. Piggy just missed Katy&#8217;s head, tumbling harmlessly
      into the ooze. Chicken Little was instantly remorseful, not on Katy&#8217;s
      account but on Piggy&#8217;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy was furious. She didn&#8217;t say a word, but walked deliberately
      over to the coop, deposited her pig very gently and started toward the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertie tried to stop her, but she shook her off. Chicken Little, too angry
      to care what happened, relieved herself of the rest of her ill-temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Go off and be hateful if you want to&#8211;a lot I care, Miss Katy
      Halford. I should think you&#8217;d be ashamed to act so when you are most
      fifteen.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A swift retort rose to Katy&#8217;s lips, but she decided it would be more
      impressive to remain dignifiedly silent. She stalked on. Gertie hesitated
      as to which of the belligerents she should follow, but finally decided in
      favor of the one who needed her worst. She put her pig in the coop and
      came to help Jane up. The latter was already ashamed of her outburst,
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_138"></a>138</span>but was far
      from being ready to acknowledge it. The other three pigs had not gone far
      and they soon had them safely in the coop. They were debating as to
      whether they should give up hunting for the others, when a hail from the
      road brought aid and comfort. Katy had met Dr. Morton coming from the
      field on an errand and had told him what they were trying to do. He was
      delighted and surprised to see the seven rescued pigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, Chicken Little, I didn&#8217;t really suppose you were in
      earnest or&#8212;&#8221; Dr. Morton stopped suddenly, he had just taken a
      good look at his only daughter&#8211;the look was effective. He threw back
      his head and roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, if you could just see yourself, Jane!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was adding insult to injury and Chicken Little burst into tears.
      &#8220;You can just hunt your old pigs yourself&#8211;I don&#8217;t think
      it&#8217;s nice of you to laugh when I tried so hard!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Come, come, I beg your pardon, but you are enough to make an owl
      laugh, Humbug. It was fine of you to try to rescue the pigs. You girls
      deserve a great deal of credit, for it is a disagreeable, muddy job. I
      guess I&#8217;ll have to make it up to you. I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll
      do. You may have this litter for your very own, and we&#8217;ll send the
      little girls their share over the cost of keeping, when the pigs are sold.
      How will that do?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_139"></a>139</span>Chicken
      Little was not in the mood to be easily appeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, but you say things are mine till you want to sell them, and
      then I never see the money.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was touching a sore point. The Doctor had been a little remiss on the
      subject of the children&#8217;s ownership of their pets. He was nettled by
      this accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My dear, when I say a thing I mean it. I was about to add, though,
      that if I give you the entire proceeds of the pigs I shall expect you to
      attend to feeding them until they are big enough to be turned in with the
      drove.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I thought the mother fed them.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, the mother pig has to be fed.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you really, truly, mean it, Father?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Truly.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little forgot the late unpleasantness. &#8220;Oh, goody, let&#8217;s
      call Katy back and tell her!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy was not so far away as might have been anticipated. Her wrath was
      dissipating also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton lingered to help them a few moments and to satisfy himself that
      they could not do themselves any damage that a bath and the wash tub could
      not repair, then left them once more to their own resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      By four o&#8217;clock they had all but one of the missing pigs safely
      stowed in the coop. They were very <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_140"></a>140</span>tired and hot, and decided to save the joy of
      hunting for the last pig for Ernest and Sherm in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well they did. The wee stray would have led them a chase. He had
      found his way almost to the creek, and it took the boys a good hour of
      wading and beating the swamp grass to discover him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Chicken Little was dropping off to sleep that night, Katy roused
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you suppose we&#8217;ll get as much as five dollars apiece from
      those pigs?&#8221;

    <h2>
      A PARTY AND A PICNIC
    </h2>
    <p>
      Gertie looked wistful. Dick and Alice were going on to Denver that morning
      to return a month later for the little girls. All three were to drive into
      town with Dr. Morton to see them off. The mere thought of anyone going
      away made Gertie a little homesick. She went out to the chicken yard,
      where nine of the young prairie chickens were flourishing under the care
      of a much-deceived hen, who had adopted them with the mistaken notion that
      they were her own egg kin. The little mottled things seemed very much out
      of place among the domestic fowls. They were wild and shy and
      astonishingly fleet on their reed-like legs. Gertie loved to watch them.
      Two of the chicks had died the first night, and one, two days later. But
      the rest survived, and, <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_142"></a>142</span>in
      the course of time, flew away to join their wild mates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Dear me, I wonder what we can do next?&#8221; said Chicken Little,
      as they watched the train pull out with Dick waving from the rear
      platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick&#8217;s and Alice&#8217;s going seemed to have finished things, at
      least for the time being. Her question was answered as soon as she got
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Jane,&#8221; said her mother, &#8220;I have just received an
      invitation for you and the girls that I am a little doubtful about. Ernest
      and Sherm are invited, too, but not to remain for the night.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Stay all night? Where, Mother, where?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;With Mamie Jenkins. The Jenkins family are hardly as refined as I
      could wish for your associates; still they are good religious people, if
      they are plain, and Katy and Gertie might enjoy going to a country party.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;A party? O Mother, please let us go.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind so much your coming to the party, but they want
      to have you stay overnight and attend a picnic some of the young people
      are getting up for the next afternoon.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy was as eager as Jane for the festivity and Mrs. Morton was at length
      persuaded to pocket her scruples and permit the girls to accept Mamie&#8217;s
      invitation. Ernest and Sherm were also delighted at the prospect of a
      frolic. They were to take the <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_143"></a>143</span>girls over and leave them for the night,
      returning the next afternoon for the picnic, which was to start from the
      Jenkin&#8217;s farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the day of the party arrived, Gertie backed out, begging to be
      left at home with Mrs. Morton. The thought of meeting so many strangers
      frightened her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I doubt if she would enjoy it. She would be the youngest one there&#8211;most
      of them will be from fourteen to twenty. The neighbors live so far apart,
      they have to combine different ages in order to find guests enough for a
      party.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, Chicken Little would not hear to Gertie&#8217;s remaining
      behind, but finding that she would really be happier at home, stopped
      urging her. Jane and Katy were soon joyfully planning what they should
      wear. They were to go in their party frocks, each taking another dress
      along for the morning and the picnic. Jane was to wear Alice&#8217;s gift.
      Katy had a dainty ruffled muslin with cherry-colored sash and hair
      ribbons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I was afraid I wasn&#8217;t going to have a single chance to wear
      it here,&#8221; she remarked naïvely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys were busy shining their shoes, and performing certain mysteries
      of shaving with very little perceptible change in their appearance. Ernest
      felt that he could not possibly go without a new necktie, but as no one
      was going to town before the event, <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_144"></a>144</span>he had to content himself with borrowing one
      from Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took the combined efforts of Marian and Gertie and Mrs. Morton to get
      the revellers dressed to their satisfaction. Gertie waited on the two
      girls as patiently as any maid. Marian was in great demand by the boys to
      coax in refractory cuff buttons and give a &#8220;tony&#8221; twist to the
      ties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Is tony the very latest, Ernest?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s what Sherm says. Just make the bow a little more
      perky, can&#8217;t you, Marian? I don&#8217;t want to look like a country
      Jake.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ernest, you are just the boy to go to Annapolis; you are so fussy
      about your clothes.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Golly, I hope I do get to go. Father hasn&#8217;t heard from the
      Senator yet, but he may be away from home.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm was struggling with his tie, getting red and hot in the process. He
      had just tied it nearly to his satisfaction, when he carelessly gave it a
      jerk and had it all to do over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Cæsar&#8217;s Ghost!&#8221; he exclaimed vengefully, &#8220;what do
      they make these things so pesky slippery for?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian laughed and Sherm colored in embarrassment over his outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Please excuse me, but this is the fifth time I&#8217;ve tied the
      critter.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_145"></a>145</span>&#8220;Let me
      try.&#8221; Marian turned him to the light and had the bow nicely exact in
      no time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls found their source of woe in their hair. Katy, having learned
      that most of the young people would be older than themselves, decided to
      put her hair up, and look grown up, too. Mrs. Morton was horrified and
      made Katy take it down. Katy, though rebellious, dared not oppose her
      hostess openly. She contented herself with taking a handful of hair pins
      along and putting it up after she reached Mamie&#8217;s. To be sure the
      heavy braids piled upon her small head looked rather queer, especially
      with her short skirts, which she could not contrive to lengthen. But Katy
      made up for this defect by an unwonted dignity, and actually persuaded a
      majority of the people she met that she was sixteen at the very least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Country folk gather early and they found the fun well started when they
      arrived. The Jenkins family had come to the neighborhood about a year
      before from Iowa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmhouse was new and rather more pretentious than most on the creek.
      Lace curtains with robust patterns draped the windows in fresh-starched
      folds. A green and red ingrain carpet covered the floor, while the entire
      Jenkins family&#8211;there were four olive branches&#8211;done in crayon
      by a local photographer, adorned the walls. It would be more <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_146"></a>146</span>truthful to say,
      adorned three walls. The fourth was sacred to a real oil painting in an
      unlimited gilt frame, which had come as a prize for extra subscriptions to
      the St. Louis <i>Globe-Democrat</i>. Mrs. Jenkins regarded this treasure
      almost with reverence. &#8220;I do think it is real uplifting to have a
      work of art in the house, don&#8217;t you, Mrs. Brown?&#8221; she had been
      heard to remark to a neighbor who failed to notice this gem. The family
      bible and a red plush photograph album rested on the marble-topped table,
      usually placed in the exact center of the room. To-night, it was pushed
      back against the wall to make more room for the games.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins were rigid Methodists and would not tolerate any such
      worldly amusement as dancing. Kissing games were substituted, and if, as
      the Jenkins believed, these were more elevating, they were certainly
      coarser and rougher than the dancing would have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamie had attended the Garland High School for one year and had acquired
      different ideas. She would have much preferred the dancing, but her
      parents were firm. Mamie deemed herself a full-fledged young lady at
      fifteen. Her highest ambitions were to have &#8220;style&#8221; and plenty
      of beaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest and Sherm had to find a place to tie the horses. They lingered also
      a moment at the pump to wash the leathery smell of the harness from their
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_147"></a>147</span>hands&#8211;a
      fastidious touch that would have subjected them to much guying if the
      other boys had seen them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Chicken Little led Katy into the crowded room, unsupported. There was
      no hall or entry and they were plunged directly into the thick of the
      party. Many of the country lads and lasses were her mates at the district
      school and greeted her cordially, eyeing Katy, however, with frankly
      curious stares. Mrs. Jenkins relieved her embarrassment by taking them
      upstairs to remove their wraps. She introduced herself to Katy before Jane
      could get out the little speech of presentation her mother had urged her
      not to forget, since Katy, being a stranger, should be made to feel at
      home as quickly as possible. Chicken Little hated introducing people and
      had been dreading the ordeal, but kindly Mrs. Jenkins took Katy by the
      hand and presented her to the whole roomful at one fell swoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;This is Miss Katy Halford, young folks, and I want you all to
      introduce yourselves and see that she has a good time or she&#8217;ll
      think you are a lot of green country jays who haven&#8217;t any manners.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;King William was King James&#8217;s son&#8221; was in full swing.
      The young folks made places for the two girls in the ring and promptly
      drew in Ernest and Sherm as soon as they entered. The lilting tune was
      sung lustily while the supposed victim in the center, <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_148"></a>148</span>a handsome lad of
      sixteen with bold, black eyes and dark curls, surveyed the girls, big and
      little, with an evident enjoyment of his privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of the older boys interrupted their singing to give him advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Take the city girl, Grant, buck up and show your manners.&#8221;
      &#8220;Bet you knew who you&#8217;d choose before you left home.&#8221;
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t let on that you don&#8217;t know which girl you want&#8211;Mamie&#8217;s
      biting her lips already to wash off that kiss.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy returned or ignored this badinage as he saw fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamie, however, was indignantly protesting that he needn&#8217;t try to
      kiss her. Grant looked in her direction and smiled as the fateful instant
      arrived. Indeed, he started toward her, then mischievously whirled around
      and seizing Chicken Little, who was whispering to Katy that Grant was
      Mamie&#8217;s beau, kissed her with a resounding smack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was taken so unawares that she had time neither to blush
      nor to protest or struggle, as was considered etiquette on such occasions.
      She didn&#8217;t even try to rub it off, as was also customary. She just
      looked at him with such a funny mixture of surprise and dismay that
      everybody roared, including Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins and some of the older
      neighbors who had come in to see the fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Here, Chicken Little, you need practice,&#8221; and <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_149"></a>149</span>&#8220;Chicken
      Little acts as if she didn&#8217;t know what kisses were. You&#8217;ll
      have to have a rehearsal beforehand next time, Grant!&#8221; &#8220;Why,
      Grant? What&#8217;s the matter with the rest of us?&#8221; These comments
      were open and noisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest took all this coarse bantering at his young sister&#8217;s expense
      good-naturedly. He knew no offence was intended. He had been present at a
      number of these rural frolics. But Sherm, town-bred and unaccustomed to
      this form of amusement, was distinctly displeased both at the kiss and the
      talk. He got Chicken Little off to one side as soon as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Say, Chicken Little, don&#8217;t let the boys kiss you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little looked concerned. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like them to, Sherm,
      but I can&#8217;t help it if I play&#8211;and they&#8217;d think I was
      awfully stuck up and rude if I refused.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Does your mother know they have this sort of games?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little made a little grimace. &#8220;Don&#8217;t go and be
      grown-up and horrid, Sherm. Everybody does it here. They&#8217;ll stop
      this pretty soon and play clap in and clap out or forfeits.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her big brown eyes were lifted so innocently and sweetly that Sherm couldn&#8217;t
      say any more, but he felt a curious desire to fight every time a big boy
      so much as stared at Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;She&#8217;s such a kid!&#8221; he explained the feeling to <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_150"></a>150</span>himself, &#8220;and
      Ernest isn&#8217;t looking after her at all.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy entered into the romping heart and soul. Katy was playing young lady.
      Her pink cheeks and laughing eyes and little flirtatious ways were very
      popular with the boys&#8211;so popular that Mamie was vexed because many
      of her mates seemed to have eyes only for the city girl, as she called her
      behind her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamie eased her mind by treating her special friends haughtily. She got
      even with the recreant Grant by choosing Ernest the very first time in
      Post Office. She even put some of the girls up to boycotting the boys who
      were hanging round Katy, for one entire game, persuading them to choose
      Ernest and Sherm alternately till the others were jealously wrathful
      without being quite sure whether it was accident or conspiracy.
      Considering his scruples about kissing, Sherm submitted most meekly. He
      had the grace to color when Chicken Little remarked carelessly: &#8220;It
      wasn&#8217;t so bad as you thought it would be, was it, Sherm?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s different with boys,&#8221; he retorted loftily.
      &#8220;Little girls like you don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Little girls! I suppose you think yourself a man grown. You needn&#8217;t
      feel so big because you&#8217;re most seventeen. I heard Dick say a boy of
      seventeen wasn&#8217;t really any older than a girl of fifteen, because
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_151"></a>151</span>girls grow up
      quicker. So there, you&#8217;re not much more than a year older than I am!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm&#8217;s &#8220;little girl&#8221; rankled not only that evening but
      for weeks afterwards. She told Katy and Mamie in strict confidence after
      they had gone upstairs that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;d show him if I were you, Jane,&#8221; advised Mamie the
      experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little needed no urging, but she was in doubt how to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My, I wish I was awfully beautiful and grown up. I&#8217;d make him
      fall so many billions deep in love with me he couldn&#8217;t squeak.&#8221;
      Jane felt positively vindictive whenever she thought of Sherm&#8217;s
      patronizing tone. She had neglected to mention to the girls the little
      conversation that had preceded her remark to Sherm. She didn&#8217;t
      consider it necessary to tell everything she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamie tittered. &#8220;Pooh, you sound as if you had been reading Sir
      Walter Scott. They don&#8217;t do things that way nowadays. When I was in
      town last winter at school I had lots of boys gone on me, and I&#8217;m
      not a raving, tearing beauty either.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamie looked as if she expected her guests to contradict her, but they
      were too much impressed with her conquests to do anything so rude. A
      little disappointed, but finding their absorbed expressions encouraging,
      Mamie preceded to retail her adventures. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_152"></a>152</span>Boiled down, these were mainly a box of candy
      and various walks taken at recesses and noons, with an occasional escort
      to a party. They were sufficiently thrilling to the others, who had never
      been permitted even such mild forms of dissipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My, wouldn&#8217;t I catch it if Papa ever caught me walking with a
      boy!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy painted the paternal wrath with a real relish. It seemed to furnish
      an adequate excuse for her having nothing to relate and put her on a
      little pinnacle of superior breeding as well. Her parents looked after
      her. It was only more ordinary people who permitted their daughters to run
      about at fifteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamie was keen enough to realize this and she promptly resented Katy&#8217;s
      patronizing tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, Pa would have been mad, too, if he had known. But I was staying
      with my aunt. She didn&#8217;t care what I did, just so I was on time to
      meals and didn&#8217;t run around after dark.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy was determined to keep up her end. &#8220;We used to have wonderful
      times at the church oyster suppers. One night last winter Dr. Wade&#8211;you
      don&#8217;t remember him, Chicken Little, he&#8217;s only been in
      Centerville about a year. Well, he took me in for oysters and bought me
      candy and three turns at the grab bag. And he is a grown-up man&#8211;he&#8217;s
      been a doctor for over two years.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_153"></a>153</span>Katy would
      hardly have told this story if Gertie had been there. She neglected to
      mention that Dr. Wade had kindly included Gertie and five other young
      girls in these courtesies. Or that he had remarked to Mrs. Halford that he
      loved to be with children because he missed his own brothers and sisters
      sadly. But Gertie was not present to mar the effect of this story with
      further particulars. Mamie began to rack her brain for forgotten
      attentions worthy to be classed with this superb generosity. Poor Chicken
      Little was hopelessly out-classed. Nothing more thrilling than being
      singled out in games and Blackman at school had happened to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Grant Stowe said you had the prettiest eyes of any girl here
      to-night. I heard him tell Jennie Brown so when she asked him whether he
      liked blue eyes or brown best. She is the awfulest thing&#8211;always
      fishing for compliments.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was generous of Mamie, for Grant was the one who had passed her by so
      recently. But Katy&#8217;s eyes were also distanced and Mamie had been
      very much thrilled by hearing that Ernest might go to Annapolis. Further,
      he had chosen her twice that evening. She felt amiably disposed toward
      Ernest&#8217;s sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the tales of past glories were exhausted, the conversation grew
      intermittent, being punctuated by frequent yawns. They were just on the
      point of <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_154"></a>154</span>dropping
      off to sleep when Mamie suddenly opened her eyes and sat up in bed with a
      jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Music! Don&#8217;t you hear it? I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if some of
      the boys were out serenading. Oh, I do hope they&#8217;ll come here.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy and Chicken Little listened breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It is!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, and it&#8217;s coming nearer.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      All three hopped out of bed and crouched down by the window. The moon was
      setting, but there was still a faint radiance. The strains were growing
      more distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I bet it&#8217;s Grant Stowe and his two cousins from the Prairie
      Hill district. They are staying all night with him and are going to the
      picnic to-morrow. Don&#8217;t you remember that red-headed boy?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It sounds like a banjo and guitar,&#8221; said Katy. &#8220;Oh, I
      do love a guitar. It always makes me think of &#8216;Gaily the troubadour.&#8217;&#8221;
      Katy gave a wriggle of delight at this romantic ending to the night&#8217;s
      festivities. She was already planning to tell the girls at home about the
      wonderful serenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tinkle tinkle of the thin notes grew stronger and clearer and they
      found that a third instrument, which had puzzled them, was a mouth organ.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I didn&#8217;t suppose anybody could really make music with a mouth
      organ, but it goes nicely with the others.&#8221; Chicken Little, like
      Katy, was more excited <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_155"></a>155</span>over
      the serenade than the party. It seemed so delightfully young ladyfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trio had one awful moment, for the music seemed to be dying away and
      still there was no human in sight. Suddenly it stopped altogether. They
      listened and waited&#8211;not a sound rewarded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I think it&#8217;s downright mean if they&#8217;ve gone by.&#8221;
      Mamie&#8217;s tone was more than injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were hardly out of her mouth when a stealthy foot-fall came
      directly beneath their window, and guitar, mandolin, and mouth organ burst
      forth into &#8220;My Bonnie,&#8221; supported after the opening strains by
      half a dozen boyish voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys had crept in so close to the wall of the house that the girls had
      not discovered them. The young ladies ducked at the first sound, and
      hastily slipped their dresses over their night gowns so they could look
      out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;O dear,&#8221; said Mamie, &#8220;I almost forgot my curl papers.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were arrayed in time to reward the serenaders with a vigorous
      clapping of hands, Father and Mother Jenkins joining in from the window of
      their bedroom downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&#8221; floated up next, followed by
      &#8220;Over the Garden Wall,&#8221; which, if not <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_156"></a>156</span>choice, had the
      distinction of being sung in New York, as Grant Stowe proudly informed
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was three o&#8217;clock past, before they finally settled down in bed
      once more. Faint suggestions of dawn were already apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s not much use to go to bed, Father always gets up at six,&#8221;
      mourned Mamie.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brilliant idea struck Katy. &#8220;Suppose we stay up all night. Grace
      Dart said she did once when her father was so sick, and she said it was
      the most wonderful thing to see the sun rise when you hadn&#8217;t been to
      bed at all.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposal met with instant favor. They clambered out of bed and lit
      the small oil lamp, wrapping themselves in quilts and petticoats
      impartially, for the air was growing chilly. The next three hours were the
      longest any of the three had ever known. In spite of fortune telling, and
      a thrilling story which Mamie read in tragic whispers, the minutes
      shuffled along like hours. Yawns interrupted almost every sentence and
      much mutual prodding and sharp reproaches were necessary to keep their
      heavy eyes open. They were too sleepy to care whether the sun rose in the
      usual sedate way or pirouetted up chasing a star. In fact, they forgot all
      about the expected sunrise. They wanted just two things&#8211;sleep and
      something to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The call to breakfast was even sweeter than the <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_157"></a>157</span>serenade had been.
      Father and Mother Jenkins were concerned at their jaded appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Seems like parties don&#8217;t agree with you young ones none too
      well. I reckon we won&#8217;t have them very often,&#8221; Father Jenkins
      remarked tartly. His own eyes smarted from loss of sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you ought to go to the picnic this afternoon
      if you are feeling so played out,&#8221; Mother Jenkins added. &#8220;Your
      Ma will think I haven&#8217;t taken good care of you. It was them
      good-for-nothing boys a-coming that wore you plumb out.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Generous cups of strong coffee&#8211;a luxury not permitted to either
      Chicken Little or Katy at home&#8211;woke them up and they got through the
      morning nicely. Not for worlds would they have missed that picnic.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even the coffee could not carry them through the afternoon. They were
      the butts of the entire party on account of their dullness and heavy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest expressed his disgust with his sister openly. &#8220;Well, I think
      Mother&#8217;d better keep you at home till you&#8217;re old enough not to
      be such a baby.&#8221; Jane had been nodding in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Looks to me as if you girls had stayed up all night!&#8221;
      exclaimed Grant Stowe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamie roused enough to retort: &#8220;Well, I guess you didn&#8217;t get
      any too much sleep yourself.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We can keep awake if we didn&#8217;t. But if it has <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_158"></a>158</span>this kind of effect
      on you, we&#8217;ll leave you out the next time we go serenading.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been arranged that they should catch fish for the picnic supper.
      The girls had brought a huge frying pan and the butter and corn meal to
      cook them in. As soon as the teams were cared for, the boys got out
      fishing tackle and bait and the party broke up into small groups for the
      fishing. Grant Stowe offered to help Chicken Little with her line. She
      found this courtesy on his part embarrassing, for Katy and Mamie exchanged
      looks, and she was so utterly sleepy, that she would have preferred Ernest
      or Sherm so she wouldn&#8217;t be expected to talk. Chicken Little had
      gone to school with Grant the preceding winter. He was always a leader in
      their school games and a great favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant found a snug place beside a deep pool that promised catfish at the
      very least, and might be expected to yield a few trout. He made her
      comfortable on the spreading roots of an elm growing upward with
      difficulty from a steep bank. Grant smiled at her as he handed her the rod
      and tossed the baited hook into the stillest part of the pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There, you ought to get a bite soon. This is one of the best places
      on the creek for catfish. Say, what did you girls do to yourselves that
      you are so used up to-day? You didn&#8217;t take a five-mile walk or
      anything after we left, did you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_159"></a>159</span>Jane laughed.
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t you wish you knew?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll find out, but I wish you&#8217;d tell me.&#8221;
      Grant looked at her from under his long black lashes. His tone was
      distinctly wheedling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little laughed again and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant threw his own line in, seating himself a little lower down on the
      bank; and quiet reigned for several minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boy was determined to get the secret from her. After a tedious
      silence, he began in a low tone so that he would not disturb the fish:
      &#8220;You know, Chicken Little, I always did think you were the prettiest
      girl in school, but you were such a kid you never took the trouble to look
      at a fellow. Seems to me you might be nice now and tell me what you did.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He neglected to mention the fact that he had bet Mamie a silk handkerchief
      against a plate of taffy that he would find out what they had been up to
      before night. He received no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, come now, be a trump and tell a fellow.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced around this time with a tenderly reproachful look. This
      tenderness speedily vanished. Jane was peacefully asleep, her head
      supported against the tree trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy&#8217;s face flushed wrathfully for an instant, but he had a
      saving sense of humor. &#8220;Serves me right for trying to get the best
      of a kid, I guess,&#8221; he said to himself. He let her sleep on
      undisturbed <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_160"></a>160</span>until
      the sound of voices announced the approach of some of the others, when he
      hastily wakened her. He did not intend to be laughed at for the rest of
      the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little found it hard to wake up and was heavy-eyed and stupid the
      remainder of the afternoon. Fortunately for her and Katy, Ernest had
      orders from his mother to be home by dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patient Gertie was waiting expectantly to hear about the good times, but
      she could hardly extract three words from either of the revellers. Parties
      and boys and finery were all stale, but their neatly made bed looked like
      heaven.

    <h2>
      BREAD AND POLLIWOGS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three days elapsed before Katy and Jane could settle down to the quiet,
      daily life of the ranch. If Gertie had found them disappointingly mute
      that first evening, she never had to complain again. They went over and
      over the thrilling events of the night and the picnic the next afternoon,
      till Gertie got sick of hearing what &#8220;Mamie said&#8221; and how <i>he</i>
      looked and how wonderful the serenade had been. Indeed, these events
      seemed to grow in importance the farther off they were. Gertie was seldom
      pettish, but Katy&#8217;s seventeenth repetition of what Grant Stowe&#8217;s
      cousin said to her while they were fishing left her cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Shut up, Katy, I&#8217;m sick of hearing about it. I don&#8217;t
      care what he said and I just know he thought you were a silly little girl
      trying to seem grown up <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_162"></a>162</span>when
      you aren&#8217;t! You know Mother wouldn&#8217;t like you to act so, and I
      guess Mrs. Morton&#8217;d be ashamed of you, too, if she knew.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Gertie Halford, if you dare tell!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, I&#8217;m no tattle tale! I intend to forget all about
      it as soon as ever I can. But I know Sherm thought you were silly from
      something he said.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little related the most presentable of their doings to Marian.
      Marian didn&#8217;t say much at the time, but some days afterwards she
      told them tales of the adventures of her own early teens. She ended a
      little meaningly: &#8220;Do you know, I believe girls can be sillier from
      thirteen to sixteen than at any other age? They&#8217;re exactly like that
      little buff cochin rooster you laugh at, because he tries to crow and
      strut before he knows how. I hope you girls won&#8217;t be in a hurry to
      grow up. There are so many nice things you can do now that you will have
      to give up after a while.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      July was growing unpleasantly hot. The mornings were dewy and fresh, but
      by noon they were glad to hunt a shady place. The apple orchard was a
      favorite haunt, and the Weeping Willows when the wind was from the right
      direction. They took books and crochetting, sometimes the checker board or
      dominoes, and spent the long summer afternoons there, with Jilly tumbling
      over their feet and Huz <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_163"></a>163</span>and
      Buz dozing alongside or lazily snapping at the plaguing flies.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been picking blackberries mornings for Mrs. Morton&#8217;s
      preserving. The rescued litter of pigs was also taking much time. The
      mother pig had developed an appetite that was truly appalling. It seemed
      to take endless gallon pails of sour milk and baskets of fruit parings to
      satisfy her. Dr. Morton would not let them feed corn in summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Dear me,&#8221; said Katy, &#8220;how big do little pigs have to be
      before they can be turned into the corral with the others?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, six or eight weeks, I guess.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They are getting awfully smelly!&#8221; remarked Gertie, holding
      her nose, &#8220;and they aren&#8217;t a bit pretty any more.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know and Father said last night we&#8217;d have to begin and feed
      the pigs some, too, before long.&#8221; Chicken Little sighed. This
      speculation in pigs had its unpleasant side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I guess we&#8217;d have to bring a lot more stuff if Ernest and
      Sherm didn&#8217;t help us out. They give them things to eat lots of
      times. But I think Jim Bart might keep the pen a little cleaner,&#8221;
      Katy observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He&#8217;s so busy he doesn&#8217;t have time.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another morning occupation was bread-making. Dr. Morton had offered a
      brand new dollar to the <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_164"></a>164</span>girl
      who would bring him the first perfect loaf of bread. They were taking
      turns under Mrs. Morton&#8217;s teaching, but it did seem as if more
      things could happen to bread. Katy would have had her perfect loaf, if she
      hadn&#8217;t let the dough rise too long. The loaves were beautiful to
      look at, but slightly sour, alas! Chicken Little spoiled her prize batch
      by sitting down to read and letting it burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertie&#8217;s first and second were very good, but a trifle too solid.
      Katy won out on her third, and produced a loaf so light and crisply brown
      that Marian said she was envious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others wanted to stop when Katy secured the dollar, but Mrs. Morton
      persuaded them to persist until they could equal Katy&#8217;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You may send one to Captain Clarke, if you wish.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      This stimulated their waning interest and they tried to produce that
      perfect loaf. A week went by before Mrs. Morton nodded approval, saying:
      &#8220;Yes, that is nice enough for a present. I am sure the Captain will
      like it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls had planned to take it over on the ponies, but Mrs. Morton
      wanted to send over two gallons of blackberries also, which was more than
      they could manage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am sending Ernest and Sherm down the creek this evening on an
      errand,&#8221; said Dr. Morton, &#8220;and <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_165"></a>165</span>they can stop at Captain Clarke&#8217;s and
      leave the things. You girls can go some other time.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little decided to send some of her spare pinks. She came in with a
      great handful just as the boys were ready to start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Where is your loaf, Chicken Little?&#8221; asked her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;O dear, I forgot to wrap it up. It won&#8217;t take a minute.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Take one of the fringed napkins to wrap it in, then put paper
      around that,&#8221; called her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Where did you put the bread, Mother?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;In the bread box, of course, child, where did you suppose?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There isn&#8217;t anything but old bread in the box.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, ask Annie.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;She&#8217;s gone to Benton&#8217;s.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, I think you&#8217;re old enough to find four loaves of bread
      in a small pantry.&#8221; Mrs. Morton got up, disgusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm stood waiting with the tin pail of berries and the bunch of flowers
      in his hands. Ernest was holding the team out at the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Morton disappeared Sherm remarked placidly: &#8220;Well, I guess
      I might as well take these things out. I&#8217;ll come back for the bread.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton could be heard exclaiming about <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_166"></a>166</span>something in the kitchen. Sherm smiled a
      fleeting smile and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sounds of hurried footfalls, of boxes and pans being moved, came from the
      kitchen. Somebody ran hastily down cellar. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t here,
      Mother.&#8221; Jane&#8217;s tone was emphatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What do you suppose is the matter?&#8221; exclaimed Katy. She
      departed to see, followed by Gertie. The sound of fresh disturbances
      floated in from the cuisine. Dr. Morton grew curious and went out to
      investigate. Sherm came back as far as the front door and stood waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, Mrs. Morton entered, flushed and annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s the queerest thing I ever heard of&#8211;that entire
      baking of bread has vanished. Annie is perfectly honest and she knew we
      were expecting to send a loaf to the Captain. You haven&#8217;t seen any
      tramps about, have you, Sherm? You don&#8217;t suppose the dogs could&#8212;&#8221;
      Mrs. Morton glanced suspiciously at Buz asleep on the path outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Nonsense, Mother, the dogs couldn&#8217;t get away with whole
      loaves of bread and leave no trace. They are not overly fond of bread,
      anyhow.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Possibly Annie may have put it in some unheard-of place&#8211;girls
      are so exasperating. I&#8217;ll go look again.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A third search was no more successful than the <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_167"></a>167</span>previous ones had
      been. They were obliged to send the boys on without the bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Chicken Little and Gertie mourned, for they had combined forces in
      this baking and were immensely proud of their effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We never can get it so nice again&#8211;I just know!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton had been studying. &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose the boys
      could have meddled with it, do you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy looked up with a gleam in her eye. &#8220;They were laughing about
      something fit to kill just before supper and they wouldn&#8217;t tell what
      it was.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But why&#8211;I don&#8217;t see.&#8221; Mrs. Morton was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;To tease the girls, possibly. But I don&#8217;t see how they could
      make away with four big loaves without being noticed.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If Ernest Morton took that bread, I&#8217;ll never forgive him as
      long as I live!&#8221; Chicken Little&#8217;s jaw set ominously. &#8220;You
      just watch me get even.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Come now, Chicken Little, we&#8217;re merely guessing the boys took
      it. Annie may have put it away in a new place, forgetting that you would
      want it to-night,&#8221; her father tried to pacify her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertie didn&#8217;t say much, but it was plain that she sympathized with
      Jane. An hour later the three girls went out to the road to watch for the
      boys&#8217; return. The lads were evidently taking their time. <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_168"></a>168</span>Nine o&#8217;clock
      came&#8211;half-past nine&#8211;still no boys! Mrs. Morton came out and
      sent the girls in to bed. They were just dropping off to sleep when the
      lads drove up.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast the next morning the entire family fell upon Ernest and Sherm
      and demanded news of the bread. Annie had returned and assured Mrs. Morton
      that it had been safely stored in the bread box before she left the house
      the evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Bread? What bread?&#8221; asked Ernest, rather too innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ernest Morton, you did something with that bread I was going to
      send the Captain. You have got to tell me where you hid it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little Jane Morton, I give you my word of honor I didn&#8217;t
      touch your old bread and I don&#8217;t know where it is.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest assumed a highly injured air. Sherm took a hasty swallow of water
      and nearly choked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family had come near believing Ernest, but Sherm&#8217;s convulsed
      face roused their suspicion afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If you didn&#8217;t, you got Sherm to,&#8221; said Katy shrewdly.
      &#8220;That&#8217;s what you were laughing about last night&#8211;I know
      it was.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s like a girl always suspecting a fellow of being up to
      some deviltry. Maybe you think we&#8217;ll keep on feeding your old pigs
      if you treat us this way.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_169"></a>169</span>Dr. Morton
      scanned the boys closely, but did not say anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane and Katy turned on Sherm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Did you take the bread?&#8221; Chicken Little had fire in her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm tried guile. &#8220;Chicken Little, do I look hungry enough to steal
      your bread? Mrs. Morton has been feeding me on good things ever since I
      came, why should I want to make away with four loaves of bread?&#8221;
      Sherm was almost eloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; observed Katy, &#8220;you don&#8217;t deny
      that you took it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Try as they would, they could get no satisfaction from the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, I know they did and I&#8217;m going to make &#8217;em wish
      they hadn&#8217;t.&#8221; Chicken Little puckered up her brow to think
      hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Of course they did or Sherm would have denied it instanter. Let&#8217;s
      think up something real mean.&#8221; Katy stood ready to second any
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertie had been in a brown study. &#8220;The boys are going off some place
      to-night. I heard Ernest ask your mother if she had cleaned that spot off
      his Sunday suit, where somebody spilled ice cream on him at the party.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I bet they&#8217;re going to see Mamie Jenkins ... they&#8217;re
      trying to sneak off without our knowing it.&#8221; Jane&#8217;s
      indignation was not lessened by this news.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_170"></a>170</span>Katy leaned
      forward and whispered something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane and Gertie clapped their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;All right, the very thing.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner the boys were rather surprised to find that the young ladies had
      dropped the subject of the bread. They were inclined to take it up again,
      but nobody seemed interested. Ernest was a little vexed to have his father
      say before them all: &#8220;It will be all right about Sherm&#8217;s
      riding the bay, only don&#8217;t stay out late, boys.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls went upstairs soon after dinner and there was much giggling from
      their room for the next two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Where ever can we put the clothes where they can&#8217;t find them?
      They make such a big bundle.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;O Chicken Little, I&#8217;ve thought of something that will be
      better than hiding!&#8221; Katy&#8217;s eyes sparkled with mischief as she
      unfolded her scheme. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hurry and fix a cord.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There&#8217;s a hook there already we can use. Mother had a hanging
      basket outside the window one summer.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We can pretend to take a walk,&#8221; added Katy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Pshaw, I want to hear them&#8211;it will be half the fun,&#8221;
      Gertie objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I said pretend&#8211;we will sneak back through the orchard. Of
      course, we&#8217;d have to be here to do it, Goosie.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_171"></a>171</span>That night
      Mrs. Morton had an early supper at the request of the boys. Immediately
      after, they armed themselves with sundry pitchers of hot water and retired
      upstairs. The girls also disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      All went well for some minutes except that Ernest cut himself in his haste
      to shave. Presently, a call for mother floated downstairs. Mrs. Morton had
      gone across the road to visit with Marian. Receiving no reply, Ernest
      called again lustily. Dr. Morton, coming in just then, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Your mother is not here, what do you want?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Send Chicken Little then.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;She&#8217;s gone for a walk with Katy and Gertie.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Thunderation! I&#8217;ve got to have somebody. Won&#8217;t you
      please call Mother?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment three girlish forms slipped into the grape arbor
      immediately below the boys&#8217; window, and concealed themselves in its
      deepest shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton came patiently home to attend to the needs of her favorite
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What is it, Ernest?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Where did you put our Sunday clothes?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Dear me, aren&#8217;t they in the closet?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;In the closet? Do you suppose I&#8217;d call you home if they were
      in the closet? They aren&#8217;t anywhere!&#8221; Ernest&#8217;s tone
      verged on the disrespectful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton toiled upstairs with a sigh. Was there to be a repetition of
      the bread episode?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_172"></a>172</span>Ernest had
      spoken the truth, the aforesaid clothes were not anywhere. The boys
      exchanged glances both wrathful and sheepish. Ernest had already exhausted
      every swear word that his mother&#8217;s presence permitted. Sherm, also
      restrained by her presence&#8211;he had retired to bed while she searched
      their room and closet&#8211;thought all the exclamations he hesitated to
      utter. Three young young ladies in the arbor beneath listened to such
      fragments of conversation as floated down to them with unholy glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, Ernest, they&#8217;re certainly not here; I&#8217;ll go look
      in Chicken Little&#8217;s room.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest accompanied her. Sherm scrambled out of bed and speedily resumed
      his ordinary wearing apparel. He was startled to perceive a bulky object
      suddenly darken their window. It was a peculiar-looking bundle from which
      coat sleeves and trousers&#8217; legs dangled indiscriminately. He had no
      difficulty in recognizing their missing clothes. He rushed to the window
      and raised the screen, calling to Ernest excitedly. He half expected to
      see the things disappear as mysteriously as they had come, but the bundle
      remained stationary. It had been raised to the window by means of a pulley
      contrived from an old clothes line and the hanging basket hook. The end of
      the cord was hidden in the arbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys secured their possessions, hastily assuring themselves that they
      were all there. Mrs. Morton <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_173"></a>173</span>started
      thankfully downstairs, but had barely reached the foot when a vigorous
      exclamation and a loud &#8220;Mother!&#8221; recalled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton had never seen Ernest so furious. Sherm didn&#8217;t say much,
      but his face was wrathfully red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What now?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Look at this!&#8221; Ernest&#8217;s voice was tragic as he held the
      garment up to view. His trousers&#8217; legs had been neatly stitched
      across twice on the sewing machine. Sherm&#8217;s, ditto. All four pair of
      sleeves were also carefully stitched with a tight tension, so they could
      not be readily ripped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton looked aghast. &#8220;It will take an hour to get that out!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Confound those kids! Mother, you can just make those smarties come
      rip that stitching out!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My son, whom are you addressing?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, Mother, I didn&#8217;t mean to be disrespectful, but this is
      a little more than I can stand! Wait till I get my hands on Jane!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You would do well to remember, Ernest, that you started this
      practical joking yourself. I hope it will be a lesson to you to refrain
      from such pranks in future.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We didn&#8217;t do anything but carry the bread over to the Captain
      without telling them. That&#8217;s where they wanted it to go.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_174"></a>174</span>Mrs. Morton
      gasped. &#8220;Did you take the whole baking?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sure, wasn&#8217;t that what you wanted?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton considered a moment before replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, Ernest, you boys have brought this annoyance upon yourselves&#8211;I
      think you will have to accept the consequences. I am too tired to fuss
      with the stitching to-night. If you go to Jenkinses you will have to wear
      your every day suits.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But Mother!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton was already descending the stairs; she did not respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest turned in despair to Sherm, who was examining the neat stitching
      ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm grinned; &#8220;Guess we might as well take our medicine. Score one
      for the kids!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I think they might take a joke the way it was intended.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They seem to have taken the joke and a few other things besides.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm chuckled. Ernest laughed, too, a little sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We&#8217;re elected to stay at home all right, but I&#8217;ll get
      ahead of them if it takes a month!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the boys had rearrayed themselves and come downstairs, the
      occupants of the grape arbor had vanished. They didn&#8217;t return until
      the <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_175"></a>175</span>enemy had
      departed for a ride to soothe its ruffled feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls retired to bed early, as innocent young people should.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Did you have a good time at Mamie&#8217;s last night?&#8221; asked
      Chicken Little at breakfast the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mamie&#8217;s? We didn&#8217;t go to Mamie&#8217;s.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No? I thought you intended to.&#8221; This from Katy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You girls do get the queerest notions in your heads,&#8221;
      observed Ernest loftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertie giggled. The boys looked at Gertie; they hadn&#8217;t suspected
      Gertie. Katy also giggled, likewise Chicken Little. There is something
      exceedingly contagious about giggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest became even loftier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You girls seem to spend about half your time cackling&#8211;I hope
      you know what you are cackling about.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We do,&#8221; retorted Chicken Little, still sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest and Sherm exchanged glances. After breakfast Ernest asked his
      mother if she had told the girls what happened the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Not a word. They didn&#8217;t ask me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Humph!&#8221; The boy was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon they took another tack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I forgot to tell you that Mamie sent her regards <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_176"></a>176</span>to you and Katy,&#8221;
      Ernest remarked casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;She said she was sorry you didn&#8217;t come, too,&#8221; added
      Sherm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane lifted her eyebrows at Katy. Katy shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;By the way, Sis, I forgot to tell you that Captain Clarke invited
      us all to come over to supper to-morrow night. He said to tell you he
      appreciated that bread very much. And while I think of it, if you can
      spare a little of your valuable time, I&#8217;d thank you to rip that
      stitching out of our clothes. I want to wear mine to the Captain&#8217;s.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;All right, we&#8217;ll rip out the stitching if you&#8217;ll bake
      us a batch of bread as good as the one you took.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Not much, Mary Ann! We took the bread to the Captain, all right.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, but we only intended to send one loaf&#8211;and, besides, you
      made us a lot of trouble.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mother, haven&#8217;t the girls got to take out that stitching?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I think Jane&#8217;s proposition is a fair one, Ernest,&#8221;
      observed Dr. Morton dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys retired to their room early that night where they worked most
      industriously with scissors and penknife and clothes brush. They had paid
      a hurried visit to Chicken Little&#8217;s room when they first came
      upstairs. This visit did much to sweeten their hour of labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_177"></a>177</span>The girls
      were spending the evening at Frank&#8217;s. They were late in getting
      home. The night was hot and they hated to go to bed until it began to cool
      off. Dr. and Mrs. Morton were sitting on the front porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Go to bed, children. Father was just starting over to call you.&#8221;
      Mrs. Morton kissed them each goodnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. and Mrs. Morton followed them in and had barely settled themselves for
      the night, when an unearthly shriek rent the air, followed by another and
      yet another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What in thunder are those children up to now?&#8221; Dr. Morton
      spoke in the tone of one who considered that patience had ceased to be a
      virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;O Mother, come quick&#8211;there&#8217;s snakes or frogs or
      something in our bed and we haven&#8217;t any light!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton hurriedly lit a lamp and went to the rescue, followed by the
      doctor armed with a stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding the lamp aloft they went into the room, the three girls, who had
      retired in a panic to the head of the stairs, bringing up the rear. Katy
      had scrambled into bed and out again in haste, dragging the coverlet and
      sheet half off on the floor. The interior of the bed was fully exposed to
      view. It was already occupied&#8211;not by snakes, but by a handful of
      fat, squirming, little polliwogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ugh, I thought it was a snake&#8211;they were so <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_178"></a>178</span>slimy and cold!&#8221;
      Katy shivered at the recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton grimly gathered up the polliwogs, then, leaving his wife to
      restore order, went into the boys&#8217; room and held a conversation
      behind closed doors. No report of what was said ever reached the girls,
      but the practical jokes ended then and there.

    <h2>
      SUPPER AT THE CAPTAIN&#8217;S
    </h2>
    <p>
      Their late unpleasantness had made the young people unusually polite to
      each other. Irritating subjects were carefully avoided the next day. When
      they set out for the Captain&#8217;s, Sherm gallantly handed Katy in to
      the front seat to sit beside Ernest, while he sandwiched himself between
      Jane and Gertie. The boys had finally concluded that the real joke was on
      them and were trying to make up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain received them at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I can&#8217;t be grateful enough for that bread. I haven&#8217;t
      had such bread since I was a boy at home. I believe I am indebted to both
      Chicken Little and Gertie for the treat. Wing Fan is consumed with envy
      and asked me to-day if I would ask the honorable miss to tell him how she
      make the so wonderful bread.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_180"></a>180</span>&#8220;I&#8217;d
      be delighted to,&#8221; replied Chicken Little, &#8220;only it took more
      than telling for Gertie and me. We tried ever so many times before we got
      it just right, but, of course, Wing understands more about cooking than we
      did.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, judging by the bread, you seem to know a good deal about
      cooking.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm could not resist. &#8220;Yes, and the girls are first rate at
      sewing, too!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too much for them all. They laughed until the Captain begged to
      be let in on the fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their host had an unexpected treat for them. &#8220;You are to help me
      christen my new row boat. It came four days ago, but I have been saving it
      until you could all go with me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He led the way down the creek to a long, deep pool, where a blue and white
      skiff floated gaily at anchor. A piece of white cardboard was tacked over
      the name so they could not see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I covered it up to see if you could guess it. I&#8217;ll give one
      of those Siamese elephants to the one who gets it first.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A lively contest followed. The girls suggested all the poetical names they
      could think of from Sea Rover to Bounding Billow. The boys, after a few
      wild guesses, settled down to the names of places in the neighborhood, and
      women&#8217;s names.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain laughed at their wild hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_181"></a>181</span>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t
      the name of any ship or famous naval hero?&#8221; Ernest asked this
      question for the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain shook his head. &#8220;Some of your neighborhood guessers were
      the nearest. There&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;m sure of, Chicken Little won&#8217;t
      guess it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was hint enough for Sherm. &#8220;Chicken Little,&#8221; he sang out
      instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Bright boy, the elephant is yours.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Did you really?&#8221; Chicken Little eyed the long strip of
      cardboard that concealed the name, incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain took out his penknife and deftly ripped the covering off.
      There it was&#8211;the letters an inch tall in white paint: &#8220;Chicken
      Little.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I think we should have a proper christening ceremony while we are
      at it. Ernest, would you mind stepping up to the house and asking Wing for
      a bottle of ginger ale?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ernest returned with the bottle of amber-colored liquid, Captain
      Clarke turned to Gertie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We must divide the honors, will you break the bottle over the bow
      while Sherm pushes off? Champagne is customary, but this is better for a
      prohibition state, and for young folks in any state.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertie took the bottle and waited for directions. The others looked on
      curiously. Sherm untied the <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_182"></a>182</span>boat,
      and, holding the cord in his hand, also waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;d better consider Ernest the crew; that cord is
      hardly long enough to permit the <i>Chicken Little</i> to float off in
      style, and we don&#8217;t want to have to swim, to bring her back. Jump
      in, Ernest; you know how to handle an oar in fresh water, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I think I can manage it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke explained to Gertie exactly how to strike the blow that
      should send the ginger ale foaming over the bow, and repeated the formal
      words of christening until she knew them by heart. Gertie was so
      interested she forgot to be shy, and performed her office with much
      spirit, repeating the &#8220;I christen thee, <i>Chicken Little</i>,&#8221;
      as solemnly as if she were standing beside a battleship instead of a
      blue-and-white row boat. It was a pretty ceremony, but it took so long
      that Wing Fan came to announce supper before they were all fairly packed
      away in the boat for their promised ride. The six were a snug fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper was served on the uncovered veranda. A stream of late afternoon
      sunshine filtered through the trees, and, with the lengthening shadows,
      cast a sunflecked pattern of branch and foliage on the white linen
      tablecloth and shining glass and silver. Some of Chicken Little&#8217;s
      own clove pinks, mingled <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_183"></a>183</span>with
      feathery larkspur and ribbon grass, filled a silver bowl in the center of
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;How did you keep them fresh so long?&#8221; Chicken Little asked
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Wing Fan performed some kind of an incantation over them. You&#8217;ll
      have to ask him.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Wing was delighted to have Jane notice them. &#8220;Velly easy keep&#8211;put
      some away in box with ice all same butter.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke had been the first person on the creek to put up ice for
      summer use and Wing was the proud possessor of a roomy ice box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It seems like home to have ice again.&#8221; Katy was stirring the
      sugar in her tea for the sheer satisfaction of hearing the ice tinkle
      against the sides of the glass. A sudden thought disturbed her. &#8220;Though
      there couldn&#8217;t be anything nicer than your spring house for keeping
      things. I don&#8217;t believe our melons at home ever got so nice and cold
      all through as yours do down in the spring stream.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s a wonderful spring you have over on the place.&#8221;
      Captain Clarke came to Katy&#8217;s rescue. &#8220;And that big oak above
      it is the finest tree in this part of the country. I&#8217;ll venture it
      has a history if we only knew it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Father is very proud of the old oak. He says it is at least
      two hundred years old. He wouldn&#8217;t take anything for it,&#8221;
      Ernest replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_184"></a>184</span>&#8220;Everybody
      calls Kansas a new country,&#8221; said Sherm, &#8220;but I guess it is
      pretty old in some ways. Kansas had a lot of history during the war.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, and lots of the people who helped make the history are living
      down at Garland now. The old Santa Fe trail runs clear across our ranch.
      You can tell it still&#8211;though it hasn&#8217;t been traveled for
      almost twenty years&#8211;by the ruts and washouts. And even where the
      ground wasn&#8217;t cut up by the countless wheels, it was packed so hard
      the blue stem has never grown there since. It is all covered with that
      fuzzy buffalo grass. In winter this turns a lighter brown than the prairie
      grass and you can see the trail for miles, distinctly.&#8221; Ernest loved
      history and politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What was the Santa Fe trail? I have heard you speak of the trail so
      much and I never knew what you meant.&#8221; Katy asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain answered: &#8220;The old trans-continental wagon road to the
      gold fields of California. You know there was a time when Kansas didn&#8217;t
      have anything so civilized as a railroad and people traveled by wagon and
      horseback&#8211;even on foot, all the way to the coast.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes,&#8221; added Ernest, &#8220;and lots of them died on the way
      or got killed by Indians.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Indians?&#8221; said Katy, &#8220;why, we haven&#8217;t seen a
      single Indian and Cousin May said she&#8217;d be afraid <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_185"></a>185</span>to come out here
      because there were lots of them still about.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Not in this part of Kansas&#8211;you needn&#8217;t lose any sleep.
      The Kaw reservation isn&#8217;t so very far away and parties sometimes
      come this way to revisit their old hunting grounds, but the Kaws were a
      peaceable tribe even in their free days.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There are lots of Indian mounds and relics around here,&#8221; put
      in Chicken Little. &#8220;Father got those arrow heads, and that stone to
      pound corn, and his tomahawk heads out of a mound over on Little John.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, and there&#8217;s a tree on the main street in town that used
      to be a famous meeting place for the Indians. Oh, we must take you all to
      see the old Indian Mission. It was used as a fort, too, more than once,
      they say. The walls are fully two feet thick.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Whew, I didn&#8217;t know you had so many interesting things round
      here!&#8221; exclaimed Sherm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We are so used to them we hardly think of them as being
      interesting. Have I ever told you about the hermit&#8217;s cave?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Hermit&#8217;s cave? No, where is it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;On the side of that big bluff just west of town. Oh, that&#8217;s
      some story. The hermit lived there until about ten years ago. Some said he
      was a Jesuit priest who lived a hermit&#8217;s life to become more holy,
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_186"></a>186</span>and others
      that he was an Italian Noble who had fled from Italy to escape punishment
      for a crime. Nobody ever really knew much about him except that he was
      highly educated and read books in several different languages. But the
      cave is still there, in the ledge of rocks near the top of the bluff.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d love to see it.&#8221; Gertie liked romantic things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;So would I,&#8221; Katy added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Me too,&#8221; echoed Sherm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Count me in,&#8221; said the Captain, &#8220;or rather let me take
      you all to town some day to explore these marvels.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They really aren&#8217;t much to see&#8211;they&#8217;re more
      interesting to tell about. But I&#8217;d be glad to see them all again
      myself,&#8221; Ernest replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wing Fan had prepared so many good things for them that none of the party
      felt energetic enough for rowing immediately after supper. They were glad
      to linger over the peach ice cream which was Wing&#8217;s crowning
      triumph, and nibble at the Chinese sweetmeats about which they were rather
      doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I ever tasted such good ice cream,&#8221;
      exclaimed Katy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I think Wing Fan must say magical words over everything he cooks&#8211;his
      things are so different and taste so good. I never thought I liked rice
      before, but his was delicious.&#8221;
    </p>
    <div class="figcenter">
      <img src="images/p0186-insert.jpg" id="img025" alt="" />
      <p class="center caption">
        And he brandished it fiercely.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_187"></a>187</span>&#8220;Wing
      Fan knows all about the family history of rice. He talks to each grain
      separately,&#8221; laughed the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys didn&#8217;t praise Wing&#8217;s efforts in words, but their
      appetites kept Wing on the broad grin. He could not resist looking proudly
      at his employer when Sherm accepted his third saucer of cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain invited them into the library to pick out Sherm&#8217;s
      elephant. They were all so interested in the curios and asked so many
      questions they came near forgetting the boat ride. Ernest picked out a
      ship&#8217;s cutlass the first thing. The Captain took it down for him to
      examine and he brandished it fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke smiled. &#8220;I fear you wouldn&#8217;t do much execution
      if you handled it that way, Ernest. A cutlass has tricks of its own. Here,
      this is the way.&#8221; He showed the boy how to get the proper hold and
      how to swing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest struck an attitude. &#8220;Behold your sailor brother as he skims
      the briny deep, Chicken Little.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Pooh, naval officers don&#8217;t carry cutlasses, do they, Captain
      Clarke?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, I believe the sword used now is straight. But this cutlass has
      a history I think might interest you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Tell us.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If you like. It won&#8217;t take long. Boys, will you <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_188"></a>188</span>draw up chairs for
      the girls?&#8221; Captain Clarke reached out his hand for a big easy chair
      nearby at the same moment that Sherm laid his hand upon it to draw it
      nearer for their host himself. The two hands rested in almost the same
      position on the opposite arms of the chair. They were singularly alike.
      Katy, the observing, noticed this instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke studied Sherm&#8217;s hand for a minute, then his gaze
      shifted to his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I doubt if my hand was ever as good looking as Sherm&#8217;s,&#8221;
      he said easily. &#8220;You have a hand that denotes unusual strength and
      will power, according to &#8216;palmology.&#8217; You will have to live up
      to it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Katy was persistent. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost exactly like yours,
      Captain Clarke, only yours isn&#8217;t so smooth and has more lines. Don&#8217;t
      you see it&#8217;s a square hand with unusually long fingers. The thumbs
      are shaped just the same, too.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You should be an artist, Katy, you are such a close observer,&#8221;
      replied the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They settled down comfortably for the story. Chicken Little noticed Sherm
      regarding his own hand rather critically and glancing from it to the
      Captain&#8217;s, who used frequent gestures as he warmed with his talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertie could not take her eyes from the cruel steel blade of the cutlass.
      &#8220;I wish there were no awful things to kill people with. I don&#8217;t
      believe <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_189"></a>189</span>God
      meant people to kill each other in battle any more than to kill each other
      when they get mad.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke smiled at her disturbed look. &#8220;That is one of the
      most terrible questions human beings have ever had to answer, little girl.
      I thought as you do once, Gertie, before the Civil War broke out. I
      loathed the histories and pictures of fighting. My schoolmates used to dub
      me a sissy because I hated the sight of blood. But when President Lincoln
      called for volunteers to save our country, when I realized that it was a
      choice between having one great free country with liberty in it for both
      blacks and whites, or letting our own race and kin leave us in hatred to
      continue the wickedness of human slavery right at our doors, it didn&#8217;t
      take me long to decide. War and all unnecessary suffering inflicted by
      human beings upon each other, are hideous. But have you ever thought how
      much more of such suffering there would be if parents didn&#8217;t inflict
      suffering upon their children to make them control their ugly passions? If
      our courts didn&#8217;t punish people for being cruel to other people? And
      when it isn&#8217;t a child or one or two grown men or women who try to be
      cruel or unjust, but a whole nation, what then? Surely other nations
      should come to the rescue of the right, even if it means war. You wouldn&#8217;t
      let a big dog kill a little one without trying to save it, would you,
      Gertie?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_190"></a>190</span>Gertie mutely
      shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Neither should Christian nations allow weaker peoples nor any part
      of their own people to be unjustly treated, when it is in their power to
      prevent it. &#8216;Am I my brother&#8217;s keeper?&#8217; will some day be
      a question every nation must answer as well as every individual.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But most of the world&#8217;s wars have been to take other nations&#8217;
      rights away from them, not to protect them,&#8221; objected Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, on one side, but in every war there has always been the side
      that fought to protect its loved ones and its homes from the brutality of
      conquerors. There is hideous wrong in every war, but the wrong is in the
      hearts of those who would rob and oppress those weaker than themselves,
      not in the patriots and heroes who resist. But I didn&#8217;t mean to
      deliver a lecture. I&#8217;d rather tell you about the brave boy who
      wielded this cutlass.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little drew her chair closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It was in &#8217;65&#8211;soon after I was mustered out of service
      at the close of the war, I was offered the command of a freighter going
      round The Horn to the Orient. I hated to leave my wife and little boy for
      a year&#8217;s voyage, especially after being away so long during the war,
      but it was the only opening worth while I could find. I guess I had the
      get-rich-quick idea, too, but never mind, that has nothing to <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_191"></a>191</span>do with the story.
      We had a terrible voyage. Storms and bad luck of every kind. The rigging
      was shrouded with ice for weeks&#8211;two men were frozen to death on
      watch. I don&#8217;t know that I blame the men as I look back. I had been
      so hardened myself by the terrible discipline and sights of war, I guess I
      didn&#8217;t take much trouble to make my crew see the necessity of some
      of our hardships. At any rate, they mutinied and would have killed me
      while I slept, but for my cabin boy. He was only sixteen, but he
      discovered the conspiracy and roused me. With the help of the other
      officers and a few loyal sailors we stood them off. Hot work it was.&#8221;
      The Captain stopped an instant, musing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people waited, expectant. Captain Clarke held up the cutlass
      reverently. &#8220;Charlie used this to good purpose after he had fired
      his last round of ammunition. I was wounded&#8211;had propped myself
      against the rail and was aiming my last precious bits of lead at the
      ring-leader, when some one jabbed a bayonet at me from the side. Charlie
      knocked it up, cutting the dastard down with a second blow that was a
      marvel. Those two strokes saved my life and saved the ship. Do you wonder
      this ugly thing looks beautiful to me?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And the boy?&#8221; Katy asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Commands a vessel of his own in the Pacific trade. I had a letter
      and a Satsuma jar from him a <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_192"></a>192</span>few
      weeks ago. But we are neglecting the <i>Chicken Little</i>! That will
      never do.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A crescent moon was visible in the sky as they came back to the place
      where the boat was moored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I fear I detained you longer than I intended with my yarn,&#8221;
      said the Captain. &#8220;It will soon be dark and that moon is too young
      to be very useful.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, it will give a good deal of light for two or three hours. I
      know every inch of the road, and even if I didn&#8217;t, the horses do,&#8221;
      Ernest replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Will you boys take the oars together or one at a time? Chicken
      Little, you girls may take turns in the bow and the rest of us will make a
      nice tight fit here in the stern.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys preferred to try their luck singly. Ernest picked up the oars
      awkwardly. He had had little experience in rowing and he felt
      self-conscious under the Captain&#8217;s eye. His first stroke sent a
      shower of drops flying over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Here,&#8221; called Sherm, &#8220;that isn&#8217;t a hose you&#8217;re
      handling!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Anyhow, the drops feel lovely and cool.&#8221; Katy was inclined to
      defend Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;A longer, slower stroke will do the work better and not blister
      your hands so quickly,&#8221; admonished Captain Clarke. &#8220;Our future
      admiral must learn to row a boat skillfully. You boys are welcome to use
      it whenever you see fit.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_193"></a>193</span>Ernest set
      his lips together firmly and soon had the boat skimming along rapidly,
      though still rather jerkily, his strokes being more energetic than
      regular. The woods were already echoing with soft night noises, frogs
      croaked; the clicking notes of the katydids mingled with the whining of
      the wind through the boughs overhead. Part of the pool disappeared in the
      shadows; the rest broke into shimmering ripples with every stroke of the
      oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I love the night time!&#8221; exclaimed Chicken Little. &#8220;Seems
      as if everything in the world had done its day&#8217;s work and was
      sitting down to talk it over&#8211;even the frogs. Don&#8217;t you s&#8217;pose
      they&#8217;re glad or sorry about things when night comes, just as we are?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm looked at Chicken Little, who was leaning over the side of the boat,
      trailing her hand in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little, you work your imagination overtime&#8211;it will
      wear out if you aren&#8217;t careful.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She rewarded him with a grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You are getting a much evener stroke, Ernest,&#8221; observed the
      Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I bet he&#8217;s getting a blister on his hand, too,&#8221; said
      Katy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Ernest, you&#8217;d better let me have a turn.&#8221; Sherm
      slid over to the rower&#8217;s seat and reached his hand for the oars,
      which Ernest yielded reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_194"></a>194</span>Sherm had
      spent one summer near Lake Michigan and was a better oarsman than Ernest.
      The boat skimmed along smoothly. &#8220;Good for you, Sherm, you have a
      strong, even stroke,&#8221; the Captain praised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the girls began to sing, Ernest and Sherm joining in. Captain
      Clarke listened happily to the young voices until they struck up &#8220;Soft
      and Low over the Western Sea.&#8221; They all loved it and were crooning
      it sweetly, but the Captain&#8217;s face went white as they sang: &#8220;Father
      will come to his babe in the nest.&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; he
      exclaimed involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all looked at him in surprise. He regained his self-possession
      instantly, saying with a smile: &#8220;Go on&#8211;don&#8217;t mind my
      twinge of rheumatism&#8211;I slept in a draught last night. That is one of
      the loveliest things Tennyson has ever written.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people finished the song and began another, but they wondered.
      The spell of the evening was broken. Soon after, they started home.

    <h2>
      CALICO AND COMPANY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton passed the muffins for the fifth time to Ernest. Ernest&#8217;s
      appetite for muffins was prodigious. Sherm was also ready for another.
      Chicken Little hadn&#8217;t quite finished hers, but at the rate they were
      disappearing&#8211;she thought she&#8217;d better. Katy said: &#8220;Yes,
      thank you,&#8221; and Gertie, who ate more slowly than the others, had
      only had one. Dr. Morton was merely waiting to be urged. Mrs. Morton rang
      the bell doubtfully. Annie had filled the plate three times already. Annie
      appeared with a questioning grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Shall I bring some bread, Ma&#8217;am? They ain&#8217;t no more
      muffins.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton laughed. &#8220;Our appetites do credit to your cooking, Annie.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_196"></a>196</span>Mrs. Morton
      sighed, then smiled as she surveyed the rosy, tanned faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There is certainly nothing like country air to make people eat. I
      wonder when Alice and Dick will be getting back. Dick said the first week
      in August probably.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; said Chicken Little, &#8220;I want to see Alice
      and Dick again, but I don&#8217;t want Katy and Gertie and Sherm to go
      home. They can only stay a few days this time, Alice said so.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go home a bit,&#8221; replied Katy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to do at home till school begins.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;d like to go home and see Mother, and then come back.&#8221;
      Gertie looked a little wistful. She did want Mother within reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I wish we could keep you all till September.&#8221; Dr. Morton
      liked to have the clatter of the young people about. &#8220;If we only
      knew some one going back to Illinois at that time to look after you. I don&#8217;t
      suppose Mrs. Halford would like to have you girls travel so far without
      some grown person along. But I don&#8217;t see why Sherm can&#8217;t just
      as well stay till time to get ready for college.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;d like nothing better, and I&#8217;m not dead sure I&#8217;m
      going to college this fall. Father seemed a little doubtful when I left,
      and the folks haven&#8217;t said anything about it in their letters. If I
      can&#8217;t, I guess <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_197"></a>197</span>I&#8217;ll
      try for a clerkship in the post-office when I go back.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton studied a moment. &#8220;How would you like to work here on the
      ranch if you don&#8217;t go to college, Sherm?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you mean it, Dr. Morton?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I surely do. Of course, Ernest&#8217;s going is not quite settled
      yet, but I have practically made up my mind that he must go off to school
      somewhere. We shall need some one to take his place and it would be very
      pleasant to have you. Chicken Little here wouldn&#8217;t be quite so
      homesick for Ernest, perhaps, if you would let her adopt you in his place.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane jumped up and down in an ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, Sherm, please do&#8211;I thought I&#8217;d just die with
      lonesomeness this winter with all of you gone, and Ernest, too.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm looked pleased at her eagerness. His news from home was still
      depressing and Sherm, if not homesick, had his lonely hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I would pay you regular wages&#8211;whatever is customary for boys
      of your age. I should have to make some inquiries,&#8221; continued Dr.
      Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, and we could go to the lyceums&#8211;they most always have one
      every winter over at the Fair View Schoolhouse. It&#8217;s heaps of fun
      when there&#8217;s snow on the ground. Frank puts the big wagon bed on
      runners and we fill the bottom with straw and buffalo <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_198"></a>198</span>robes and all
      snuggle down together. You just must stay, Sherm!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Perhaps he will, if you don&#8217;t talk him to death, Chicken
      Little. You haven&#8217;t given him a chance to get in a word edgeways.&#8221;
      Ernest reproved his sister sharply after the manner of brothers slightly
      older.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What about you?&#8221; retorted Chicken Little. &#8220;Sherm, we&#8217;ll
      all keep quiet and let you have a chance.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;d like to, if college is ruled out, and Mother and Father
      will let me. They may want me at home, especially if Father grows worse.&#8221;
      Sherm gave a little gulp. He was very fond of his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll write to him to-day, Sherm, and you might write, too,
      for I&#8217;m going in to town about noon. Any commissions, Mother? Why
      don&#8217;t you drop things and come along? A change will do you good&#8211;you
      haven&#8217;t been off the place for two weeks or more.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know but I will. Chicken Little, you girls might get
      up a little picnic lunch for yourselves and the boys, and have it out in
      the orchard. Annie has a big ironing to-day and it would help her out not
      to have a dinner to get. Then we&#8217;ll have a hearty supper this
      evening.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, and Chicken Little, did you girls feed the <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_199"></a>199</span>porkers last
      evening? I heard them squealing and grunting in the night.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Golly!&#8221; said Chicken Little, sitting up with a start and
      looking at Katy. Katy looked guilty, and Gertie concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton did not need any further answer. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;d
      better run right out. Remember dumb beasts must never be neglected,
      daughter.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And Jane, I don&#8217;t want to hear you say Golly again. By-words
      of any kind are objectionable for young girls, and that is particularly
      rough and coarse,&#8221; Mrs. Morton added severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You never say it is coarse when Ernest says it&#8211;and he uses it
      an awful lot.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My dear, you are not a boy,&#8221; Mrs. Morton replied with a
      dignity that was final.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; said Chicken Little when the trio got
      out doors, &#8220;it&#8217;s not one bit fair to let boys do so many more
      things than girls! You just wait, if I ever have a daughter she&#8217;s
      going to do every single thing her brother does. So there!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm overheard and later in the day when he and Jane were talking
      together, he remarked: &#8220;Chicken Little, I don&#8217;t think it is
      exactly fair either to hold the girls in so much tighter than boys, but
      your mother is right, allee samee. I have heard the fellows talk often
      enough to know they think a lot more of a girl who isn&#8217;t slangy,
      than of one who is. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_200"></a>200</span>Of
      course, mild ones like &#8216;Oh dear&#8217; don&#8217;t matter, but you
      see a man kind of likes to have a girl, well&#8211;different.&#8221; Sherm
      was getting in a little beyond his depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls carried two pails of sour milk and a great basket of parings to
      their greedy pigs and watched them feed without interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The only reason I&#8217;m glad to go home is I won&#8217;t have to
      feed these horrid pigs any more. I never saw anything grow and eat like
      they do. They ought to be worth a lot of money after all the stuff they&#8217;ve
      eaten.&#8221; Katy kicked her toe against the log pen to emphasize her
      remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re worth so very much yet.&#8221;
      Chicken Little was regarding them with no very friendly eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind so much if they weren&#8217;t getting so ugly
      and smelly,&#8221; said Gertie plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank, happening by just then, was amused to see their disgusted
      expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Say, Frank, how soon will these pigs be big enough to go in the
      corral with the others?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank&#8217;s eyes twinkled. He came up and scanned the ten muddy,
      impudent pigs, who were already coming up to the sides of the pen,
      grunting for more. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said judicially, &#8220;I think
      perhaps you will be rid of them inside of two or three months, but they&#8217;ll
      eat a lot more from now on.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_201"></a>201</span>The three set
      up a united protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Father said it would only be a few weeks when we caught them, and
      it&#8217;s been five already,&#8221; Chicken Little remonstrated hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, don&#8217;t go for me. You asked for my opinion and I gave it
      to you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank grinned so broadly that Jane grew suspicious. &#8220;Pooh, you&#8217;re
      teasing, I&#8217;ll ask Father to-night.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls scoured the pantry and spring house for provender for the
      picnic. Sherm and Ernest would be in from the meadow where they were
      cutting down thistles about half-past twelve. Bread and butter and cold
      ham were flanked with cookies, pie, and musk melons. Annie wanted them out
      of her road as speedily as possible, so they took their stuff all down to
      the orchard and stowed it away in the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Now what?&#8221; demanded Katy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Wish we could think of something new.&#8221;
      Chicken Little stared up and down the rows of apple trees, seeking an
      inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her glance fell upon a lone apple tree standing in the center of an open
      space, apart from all its fellows. Katy&#8217;s glance followed hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why is that old tree all by itself that way?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8211;they were all big trees when we came here.
      It is a bell-flower and we call it Old <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_202"></a>202</span>King Bee. Say, I&#8217;ve got an idea. Let&#8217;s
      get Calico and Caliph and play riding school&#8211;you remember that
      article in &#8216;The Harper&#8217;s&#8217; about a riding school in New
      York, and you said you wished you could go.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Would Ernest let us take Caliph?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I know I could ride him if I tucked my
      skirts up and used the man&#8217;s saddle. There can&#8217;t a soul see us
      here; it&#8217;s so shut in by the trees.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It would be fun. Let&#8217;s try to ride bare back and do stunts to
      surprise the boys. I wish we could take our skirts clear off&#8211;they
      catch so on the saddle horn and in the stirrup buckles.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I tell you what we&#8217;ll do.&#8221; Chicken Little&#8217;s eyes
      danced impishly. &#8220;There are lots of Ernest&#8217;s old trousers in
      the lumber-room closet that he outgrew ever so long ago. I believe we
      could find some to fit all of us. Let&#8217;s go see.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A swift rummage of the dusty closet set them all sneezing, but they
      triumphantly brought forth an armful of defunct trousers and carried them
      up to their room. For the next fifteen minutes such giggles and
      exclamations and shrieks of laughter escaped from their room that Annie
      left her ironing to see what was up. An astonishing sight met her gaze.
      Once started upon the dressing-up craze, the girls had not been content
      with one garment. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_203"></a>203</span>Chicken
      Little had daringly ransacked not only Ernest&#8217;s bureau, but Sherm&#8217;s
      possessions, in quest of shirts and ties.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had decked herself in a blue checked cheviot shirt, tucked into blue
      serge trousers, liberally patched at the knees. Sherm&#8217;s best red tie
      was neatly knotted at her throat, and an old straw hat adorned with a red
      hair ribbon, topped her brown braids. Katy was resplendent in a tan
      colored shirt, with a bright green tie popularly supposed to belong to
      Ernest. Her own black sailor finished her off nicely. Gertie had a faded
      pink shirt, which dated back to Centerville days&#8211;all Ernest&#8217;s
      more recent garments being too big for her slim little figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie threw up her hands. &#8220;You&#8217;re a pretty-looking lot. I&#8217;d
      just like to have the Missus see you now. I bet you&#8217;d catch it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Annie had troubles of her own and retired to her ironing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trio slipped out the back way&#8211;they didn&#8217;t care to have
      Marian see them, and they didn&#8217;t wish to bother with Jilly. The
      stable was deserted. They quickly saddled Caliph after making friends&#8211;with
      sundry lumps of sugar. Calico was equipped only with a saddle blanket and
      girth. Gertie decided that she would let the others experiment first, so
      she walked back to the orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s try them down the lane first. They will be <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_204"></a>204</span>easier to manage on
      a straight road than in among the trees, if they are fractious.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane helped Katy upon Calico&#8217;s back and showed her how to press her
      knees against the sides to secure her seat in the place of stirrups.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You can put your hand under the girth if you begin to slip.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy took a turn or two and decided she could stick on if Calico didn&#8217;t
      trot. He was a single footer and had a very easy gait except on the rare
      occasions when he insisted upon breaking into a hard trot. Chicken Little
      led Caliph to the fence. She wanted to be sure that she was well in her
      seat before Caliph discovered she was a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Caliph liked Chicken Little, and not having any skirts to make him
      suspicious, seemed inclined to take her for what she seemed. He noticed
      only that he had a lighter hand on the reins. He dashed off as lightly and
      smoothly as if Ernest or Sherm were on his back, and Chicken Little was in
      a transport of pleasure and triumph to think she could ride him. Katy had
      a harder time, but she stuck on pluckily for three turns up and down the
      lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      They didn&#8217;t dare linger too long lest some neighbor come by and see
      them. So they presently turned off upon the faint track that led through
      the gate into the orchard. Gertie was awaiting them under the big tree.
      Katy slipped off Calico to give Gertie <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_205"></a>205</span>her turn. Chicken Little led the way on Caliph
      and they went round and round the tree, faster and faster, till both were
      ready for a rest. The ponies were fresh and seemed to enjoy the sport as
      much as they did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy tried Calico next, enchanted to find she could stick on at a canter.
      By this time they were ready for something new.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you suppose we could ride backwards?&#8221; Katy was in a daring
      mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could and they did, though Calico was a little doubtful as to whether
      he approved of this innovation. It was not exactly comfortable for anyone
      concerned and they soon gave it up. But when Chicken Little tried to make
      the intelligent pony dance on his hind legs, Calico waxed indignant.
      Instead of rising gracefully, he gave two short, plunging leaps,
      descending with forelegs rigid and head down, a maneuver which sent his
      mistress flying over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turf was soft and she was up in a trice, gripping Calico&#8217;s rein
      before he could make use of his freedom. The crowning feat of the morning
      was another of Chicken Little&#8217;s brilliant ideas. They had tethered
      the ponies by their bridle reins and were letting them graze on the
      orchard grass while they stretched out and rested. Suddenly Jane sat up
      with a start and began to take off her shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_206"></a>206</span>&#8220;What
      on earth are you going to do now, Jane Morton?&#8221; demanded Katy
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Wait and see. I&#8217;m most sure I can. I want you to lead Calico
      very slowly.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy obediently followed directions. Chicken Little put her hand on the
      girth and vaulted on his back. She rode once around the tree tamely, then
      slowly got to her feet on Calico&#8217;s slim back, bidding Katy steady
      her. She succeeded in going about three feet with this precarious footing
      before she lost her balance and slid harmlessly down on the pony&#8217;s
      back. Calico did not look specially pleased at the jounce she gave him as
      she lit. She persevered until she could go round the tree, then insisted
      upon trying it alone. Katy and Gertie both remonstrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;ll get killed! Calico doesn&#8217;t like it a bit.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I won&#8217;t&#8211;I tried once all by myself last summer on old
      Kit, but Calico&#8217;s harder, because he isn&#8217;t so fat. You wouldn&#8217;t
      hurt me, would you, Calico?&#8221; She put her arm around his neck and
      squeezed him hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calico whinnied and began to nose her for sugar. She produced two lumps,
      and stroked him, talking to him in whispers while Katy hooted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;A lot of good that will do.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little got up again with Katy&#8217;s help, then started off
      slowly by herself. Calico moved carefully at a snail&#8217;s pace. She
      made the entire circuit <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_207"></a>207</span>of
      the tree successfully this time. Again she went around, increasing the
      speed of Calico&#8217;s walk. She was so jubilant she grew reckless and
      clucked, which was Calico&#8217;s signal to canter. He responded promptly
      and with equal promptness, she slid down on him kerplunck. Calico laid
      back his ears in disapproval, and looked around inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Katy had plucked up her courage and wished to try it. She was
      entirely willing, however, to have Chicken Little at the pony&#8217;s
      head. Katy slipped, too, but she was lighter, and Calico was growing used
      to it and did not mind so much. Chicken Little patted him each time and he
      soon ceased to notice the bumps. Gertie preferred to be a spectator at
      this stunt, but the others persisted until Jane succeeded in going round
      the tree once with Calico pacing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Golly, I wish Ernest and Sherm could see us!&#8221; Chicken Little
      was already sighing for new worlds to conquer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You said Golly again.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Golly, I did, didn&#8217;t I? It&#8217;s awfully hard to quit
      anything like that. Say, I want you girls to pinch me every time I say it,
      then I&#8217;ll remember.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;ll get mad if we do,&#8221; replied Gertie, wise beyond
      her years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, I won&#8217;t! Honest to goodness I won&#8217;t. I truly want
      to stop it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_208"></a>208</span>&#8220;All
      right,&#8221; said Katy firmly, &#8220;but you will get more pinches than
      you are expecting.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy and Gertie and poor Calico were all ready to settle down for a rest.
      But Chicken Little was burning to show off before Ernest and Sherm. She
      untied Caliph and took several turns around the tree, going faster and
      faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Pooh,&#8221; she said after a while, &#8220;I bet I could ride
      Caliph anywhere. Suppose we go meet the boys. You and Gertie can both ride
      Calico bare back. I guess they&#8217;ll be surprised. It&#8217;s most
      noon; I can tell by the sun.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But Jane, we can&#8217;t go to meet the boys this way.&#8221;
      Gertie looked distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I forgot. What can we do? I&#8217;d be afraid to ride Caliph
      with even a short skirt&#8211;he&#8217;s never had a woman on him before.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What if the boys do see us? Nobody else is likely to come along
      just at noon. Anyway, your father thinks it&#8217;s dangerous for girls to
      wear long skirts to ride in. I heard him say so.&#8221; Katy was plausible
      and Chicken Little wanted to be persuaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t care, if you don&#8217;t.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;All right, let&#8217;s do it. I think you look real nice that way,
      Chicken Little, honest I do.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, they&#8217;re heaps more comfortable. I feel so light. You
      make an awfully cute boy, Katy, and <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_209"></a>209</span>Gertie is just sweet. And you couldn&#8217;t
      ride bare back half so well sidewise.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      It took some persuasion to secure Gertie&#8217;s consent, but she finally
      gave in.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode gaily out into the lane. Calico was too tired to make any
      protest to his double burden. Once in the lane, they waited in the shade.
      But the boys did not come. They waited until Jane was sure it must be one
      o&#8217;clock and their appetites suggested two at the very earliest.
      Calico waited patiently enough, but Caliph was uneasy over the flies.
      Finally, they decided to give the boys up and go back and have their
      picnic alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We might take one gallop down the line to the creek to make sure
      they&#8217;re not in the meadow,&#8221; Katy suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I bet they finished the weeds sooner than they expected and went
      fishing.&#8221; Chicken Little strained her eyes in the direction of the
      meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      They started the horses off at a smart pace, then faster and faster, till
      they broke into a swift gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it glorious?&#8221; Chicken Little called back. She was
      several lengths ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not hear Katy&#8217;s response. A jack rabbit, frightened by the
      approaching horses, broke cover from some wild blackberry bushes that grew
      over the stone wall, and dashed across the road directly in front of
      Caliph. The spirited beast shied violently, <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_210"></a>210</span>then leaped forward, throwing Chicken Little
      neatly off into the exact middle of the dusty lane. Her pride was more
      hurt than she was. She tried to stop him by calling &#8220;Whoa&#8221;
      lustily. But Caliph seemed to have a pressing engagement elsewhere. He
      quickly disappeared around a bend in the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls looked at each other in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little got hastily to her feet. There was no time to nurse
      bruises. She must catch Caliph somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Golly, he&#8217;s got that beautiful Mexican saddle on and he may
      take a notion to roll. I knew I hadn&#8217;t any business to take it, but
      I wanted to ride him just as Ernest does.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy and Gertie noticed the &#8220;Golly,&#8221; but there seemed to be
      more important business on hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you suppose you could take Calico and catch him?&#8221; asked
      Katy anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I guess I&#8217;ll have to try.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy and Gertie climbed down and Chicken Little swung herself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Maybe one of you&#8217;d better come, too, to hold Calico and ride
      him home if I catch Caliph.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll come, and Gertie had better run and change her clothes
      and go back to the orchard to give the boys their lunch, if they come
      before we get back. Don&#8217;t tell them where we&#8217;re gone.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_211"></a>211</span>&#8220;Nor
      about Caliph, Gertie, you can say we&#8217;ll be back in a minute.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy had mounted behind Jane while she was giving this last direction and
      poor Calico started off at a gallop. They crossed the creek and came to
      the place where the road forked just beyond the timber without seeing hide
      or hair of Caliph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He must have streaked it. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;d take the
      road to town&#8211;he must have gone straight home to the Captain&#8217;s.
      Oh, dear, I&#8217;ll have to tell him I used Ernest&#8217;s horse without
      permission, and I&#8217;ve got these awful clothes on! It just seems as if
      the Captain has to know every single bad thing I ever do.&#8221; Chicken
      Little heaved a long sigh and clucked to Calico.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had almost reached the Captain&#8217;s gate when they saw Wing Fan
      approaching on horseback, leading the truant Caliph. Chicken Little was
      immensely relieved to find, as they came near, that neither saddle nor
      bridle had suffered from the run away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wing Fan was also greatly relieved to find that no one had been hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Me velly &#8217;fraid honorable brother have bad fall. Captain
      Clarke no home. I bring horse, find out.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Wing held Caliph while Jane mounted, and rode a little way with her to
      make sure he would not be fractious, but Caliph seemed to have had his
      fling and bowled along smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_212"></a>212</span>In the
      meantime Ernest and Sherm had arrived and were plying Gertie with
      questions between mouthfuls. Gertie parried as long as she could, shutting
      her lips together tight when they began to press her too hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;d just like to know what they are up to now. That precious
      sister of mine can get into more scrapes than any kid I ever saw.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And Katy isn&#8217;t far behind her,&#8221; added Sherm, hoping
      Gertie would try to defend her absent sister and let something out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little and Katy took the horses to the barn, carefully unsaddled
      Caliph, and rubbed both horses down and fed them, before going back to the
      orchard. They forgot all about their unusual dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived there, tired and flushed, in time to help the boys finish the
      last melon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You mean things to eat the melons all up.&#8221; Chicken Little
      almost forgot her own offense in her disgust over their greediness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys did not waste time defending themselves; their attention was
      concentrated on the girls&#8217; peculiar costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, what in the demnition bow wows have you been doing now,
      Chicken Little Jane Morton?&#8221; Ernest&#8217;s gaze wandered from his
      sister to Katy, who suddenly became self-conscious and tucked her feet
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_213"></a>213</span>and as much
      of her trouser-clad legs as she could manage, underneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little gave a start of surprise, then faced Ernest boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, just having a little fun.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Ernest was beginning to grasp details. &#8220;Suppose next
      time you start out to have fun you let my things alone. Isn&#8217;t that
      Sherm&#8217;s best tie you&#8217;ve got on?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little clutched the offending tie and glanced hastily at Sherm.
      The boy was regarding her with a peculiar expression, both admiring and
      disapproving. There was no denying that Chicken Little made a most
      attractive boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The swift color swept into the girl&#8217;s face as she caught Sherm&#8217;s
      glance. &#8220;Oh, dear, and he had told her only that morning that girls
      should be different!&#8221; She liked Sherm&#8211;she didn&#8217;t want
      him to think she was a bold, awful girl. Some way their prank seemed to
      need excusing. She replied to the look in Sherm&#8217;s eyes rather than
      to her brother&#8217;s accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We&#8211;I wanted to ride Caliph&#8211;I just knew I could if I
      didn&#8217;t have a lot of horrid skirts to frighten him. And we did
      beautiful stunts and we couldn&#8217;t, if we hadn&#8217;t put on your old
      things. I bet if you had to wear cluttering things like skirts all the
      time you&#8217;d be glad to take them off some times, too.&#8221; <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_214"></a>214</span>Chicken Little&#8217;s
      big brown eyes sought Sherm&#8217;s appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest answered before Sherm could say anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, you can settle with Mother about the skirts, but I&#8217;ll
      thank you to let Caliph and my best ties alone.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Did you ride him?&#8221; asked Sherm. &#8220;You&#8217;re welcome
      to my tie, Chicken Little. It&#8217;s very becoming.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little felt subtly consoled. &#8220;Yes, I rode him, but he threw
      me once,&#8221; she confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He threw me once, too,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;You&#8217;d
      better be a little careful.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm grinned and Chicken Little smiled back happily.

    <h2>
      DICK AND ALICE GO ON ALONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dr. and Mrs. Morton got home about four o&#8217;clock. The girls had
      studied some time as to whether they should make a clean breast of the
      morning&#8217;s doings, but Ernest, urged on by Sherm, had discouraged
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You needn&#8217;t be afraid I&#8217;ll peach, Sis. You&#8217;re an
      awful good rider for a girl and I don&#8217;t mind your taking Caliph so
      long as you didn&#8217;t get hurt. And I guess it was sensible of you not
      to try him with skirts. But you&#8217;d better be careful. You&#8217;re
      getting most too big for such tom boy business.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t anything really wrong,&#8221; argued Chicken
      Little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know my mother wouldn&#8217;t have cared way off out here in the
      country.&#8221; Katy added her mite to the whitewashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_216"></a>216</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t
      think it was wrong, but I guess your mother wouldn&#8217;t be pleased to
      hear about it,&#8221; observed Gertie sagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;She isn&#8217;t going to,&#8221; said Chicken Little with decision.
      &#8220;I shall tell Father instead.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father only laughed. Mrs. Morton did not learn of it until the girls had
      gone home to Centerville, when Chicken Little, wishing to convince her
      that she could ride Caliph safely, let it out, and received the
      long-delayed scolding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after the riding school, a letter came from Dick and Alice,
      saying they would arrive Sunday and must leave for Centerville the
      following Saturday. The same mail brought a letter for Sherm from his
      mother, and another from Mrs. Dart to Dr. Morton. The doctor did not
      mention the contents of his until the boy had finished reading his own.
      Then he stepped over to his side and laid his hand gently upon his head.
      Sherm was looking pretty sober. &#8220;Can you be content to be our boy
      this winter, Sherm?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, you&#8217;re mighty good to want me. I&#8211;I guess
      there&#8217;s no college for me this winter. Father&#8217;s no better. I
      wish&#8211;excuse me.&#8221; Sherm finished abruptly and bolted out of the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little looked after him with some concern. She turned inquiringly
      to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Poor lad,&#8221; he said in response to her look, &#8220;his <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_217"></a>217</span>father is no better&#8211;will
      be a helpless invalid to the end, I judge, more from what Mrs. Dart doesn&#8217;t
      say than from what she does. I&#8217;m afraid their affairs are in bad
      shape. Dart&#8217;s illness must have cost enormously and they have had no
      man to look after their business. She writes that Sue is to be married
      quietly next month. She says they are sadly disappointed not to have Sherm
      home for this event, but feel that he will be better off to stay with us
      this winter, and she can hardly afford to have him come so far just for a
      short visit. There is something sort of queer about the letter&#8211;something
      mysterious, as if she were keeping the really important facts to herself.
      See what you make of it, Frank.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed the letter to Frank, who had just walked in with Jilly perched
      on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little did not wait for Frank&#8217;s verdict, she slipped out the
      door in search of Sherm. Her first guess was the stables and she made a
      hurried survey of stalls and hay mow. He was not there. She tried the
      orchard next, then the arbor. Perhaps he had taken one of the ponies and
      gone for a ride. No, she remembered both Calico and Caliph had whinnied as
      she went by their stalls. He might have walked down the lane. She went
      clear to the ford and hunted among the trees for a short distance up and
      down the bank. He was nowhere in sight. Coming back, she caught sight of
      the tops of the <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_218"></a>218</span>Weeping
      Willows and, remembering that Sherm sometimes went there Sundays with a
      book, she stole up quietly. He had thrown himself down on the ground under
      the interlacing branches. No, he was not crying&#8211;just lying perfectly
      still, staring up into the boughs above him with such misery in his face,
      it hurt her to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hardly knew what to do. She knew Ernest generally preferred to be let
      alone when things went wrong, but then Ernest had never come up against
      any real trouble. She suspected that Sherm&#8217;s was very real. Chicken
      Little watched him for several minutes, undecided. He did not stir.
      Finally, she decided she didn&#8217;t care whether Sherm wanted her round
      or not, she wasn&#8217;t going to go off and leave him to grieve all
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherm,&#8221; she called softly. The boy raised up on his elbow.
      &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he asked rather gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner didn&#8217;t suggest any longing for her society, but she
      persevered. &#8220;I won&#8217;t bother you but just a minute, Sherm, but
      I&#8217;m awful sorry&#8211;about your father&#8211;and college and
      everything.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm did not answer or look at her. The tender note of sympathy in her
      voice was imperilling his self-control. He didn&#8217;t mean to play the
      baby, especially before a girl. But the braver the boy was, the more
      Chicken Little burned to comfort him. She <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_219"></a>219</span>stood for a moment staring at him helplessly,
      the tears welling up into her own eyes. Then on a sudden impulse she
      dropped down beside him, and before he could protest, began to stroke his
      hair. Sherm tolerated the caressing fingers for a few minutes, but his
      pride would not let him accept even this comforting. He dabbed his eyes
      fiercely. &#8220;Don&#8217;t, Chicken Little, don&#8217;t! You&#8217;re a
      trump to stand by a fellow this way. I am all right&#8211;I just got to
      thinking about Father&#8211;and Sue&#8217;s going.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm would have carried it off beautifully if he hadn&#8217;t attempted a
      smile, but his heart was too sore to quite manage that. The smile vanished
      in a hasty gulp, and, burying his face on his arm, he had it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little&#8217;s eyes were redder than Sherm&#8217;s when she got up
      to go back to the house. Sherm noticed her tear-stained appearance.
      &#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; he ordered bruskly. He ran down to the spring
      stream just beyond the willows and soaking and rinsing out his
      handkerchief, brought it dripping to her. &#8220;Mop your eyes, Jane, they
      look awful. There&#8211;that&#8217;s better. I&#8217;ll be along pretty
      soon!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton had not considered it necessary to inform Katy and Gertie that
      she had also written to their mother, asking if their visit might be
      prolonged until the last of August. Mrs. Morton was firm in the opinion
      that every detail of children&#8217;s <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_220"></a>220</span>lives should be settled by their elders for
      their best good, and she expected the children to be properly thankful.
      Her expectations had not always been realized with her own children&#8211;all
      three having often very definite ideas of their own as to what they wanted
      and what they didn&#8217;t want. But in this instance she was not
      disappointed. The joy was general when Mrs. Halford wrote that the girls
      might remain until the twenty-eighth, when a business friend of Mr.
      Halford&#8217;s would be coming through Kansas City, and would meet the
      girls there and bring them on home. To be sure, Gertie had a bad half hour
      thinking how much longer it would be before she could see Mother, but she
      soon forgot all this in the bustle of preparation for Alice and Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian and Frank had arranged several excursions for their last days at
      the ranch. They had seen fit to include the young folks in only one of
      these&#8211;a day in town when they were to go to the old Mission and look
      up some interesting Indian Mounds in the neighborhood. Captain Clarke was
      to be of the party, and, true to his promise, insisted upon driving the
      boys and girls in himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon Alice and Dick were expected, the girls were down the lane
      watching for the first glimpse of the bay team, to greet them. They had
      arrayed Jilly in white with a wreath of forget-me-nots on her blonde curls
      and a small market basket <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_221"></a>221</span>full
      of hollyhock blooms to scatter in the pathway of the expected guests.
      Frank was responsible for the hollyhocks. Flowers were becoming scarce, it
      had been so dry, and Chicken Little was bemoaning the fact that they could
      hardly find enough to trim up the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Hollyhocks, sure. There&#8217;s a whole hedge of them right at your
      hand. Nothing could be more appropriate for returning honeymooners.
      Further, they&#8217;re gaudy enough to compete with the two inches of dust
      in the lane. If we don&#8217;t have rain pretty doggoned soon we won&#8217;t
      have any crop.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Mrs. Morton and Marian looked up anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You don&#8217;t think&#8212;?&#8221; Marian hesitated. She did not
      wish to burden Katy and Gertie with family worries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think, not being in the weather man&#8217;s
      confidence. But a rain inside of the next three days would mean hundreds
      of dollars to the Morton family and the whole Eastern half of Kansas as
      well.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little&#8217;s mind flew instantly to Ernest&#8217;s cherished
      hopes. &#8220;Oh, can&#8217;t Ernest go to college if we don&#8217;t have
      rain?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t bother your head, Chicken, we&#8217;ll find some way to
      take care of Ernest. Go back to your decorations.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest and Sherm had spent the preceding evening <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_222"></a>222</span>erecting a
      remarkable arch over the front gate with &#8220;Welcome to Our City&#8221;
      done in charcoal letters a foot high on a strip of white paper cambric,
      depending from it, and an American flag proudly floating above. The girls
      completed this modest design by trimming up the gate posts with boughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton&#8217;s preparations were more practical. Three peach and
      three custard pies crowded a chocolate cake and a pan of ginger cookies on
      the lowest pantry shelf. The bread box lid would not shut, the box was so
      full, and a whole boiled ham was cooling down at the spring house, not to
      mention six dismembered spring chickens which had been offered up in place
      of the regulation calf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t mind if they had cooked two of the pigs,&#8221;
      groaned Katy. They were giving their charges an extra big feed, being
      fearful lest they should forget them in the excitement of the guests&#8217;
      arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Neither would I,&#8221; Chicken Little replied with a sigh. &#8220;I&#8217;m
      sick of the sight of &#8217;em!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertie threw a carrot and hit the one time beauteous white one with the
      curly tail, so smart a rap on his snout that he squealed his disapproval
      while his relatives bagged the carrot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if I don&#8217;t get any money for my share of
      &#8217;em,&#8221; said Katy after a pause of disgusted contemplation of
      the pigs. &#8220;I&#8217;d have to spend it <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_223"></a>223</span>for something useful like as not, or give some
      of it to the heathens. Let&#8217;s give them back to your father.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;d just as lief, only Frank and the boys would tease us
      everlastingly if we backed out now&#8211;and we&#8217;ve worked so hard!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;d just as lief quit.&#8221; Gertie&#8217;s
      discouraged expression was so funny that Chicken Little laughed and
      Gertie, the patient, flared. She hated to be funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Stop it&#8211;I am not going to help you feed those horrid pigs
      another time, Chicken Little Jane Morton. I&#8217;ve just been doing it to
      help you out. And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a suitable occupation for
      girls&#8211;or company!&#8221; Gertie climbed down from her perch on the
      log pen and departed with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Humph, I guess I never asked you to help me. Besides, you expected
      to get as much money as I did. You can just go off and sulk if you want
      to.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think that is a nice way to talk to your
      guests.&#8221; Katy climbed down and departed to soothe her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little whacked her heels against the logs and made a face at the
      nearest pig to relieve her feelings. She loathed the creatures. She wished
      she could wipe them off the face of the earth. Katy was half way to the
      house when she had an inspiration. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_224"></a>224</span>&#8220;Katy!&#8221; she called eagerly,
      &#8220;Katy, I&#8217;ve got an idea.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy continued her way without glancing &#8217;round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s something you&#8217;ll like.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy wavered and unbent enough to ask: &#8220;What is it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Come here and I&#8217;ll tell you. I&#8217;m not going to yell it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy considered and finally returned reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came back to the pen, Chicken Little glanced round to make sure
      that no one was about, to overhear, then, to make sure, whispered
      excitedly into Katy&#8217;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy&#8217;s face lighted. &#8220;All right, let&#8217;s. Gertie won&#8217;t
      care.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They had entirely made up this slight unpleasantness by afternoon. Perched
      on rocks under the shade of the cherry trees they waited impatiently for
      Dick and Alice. Jilly had been coached in her little speech so often that
      there was no doubt at all that she would get it wrong. She had been told
      to say, &#8220;Welcome, Uncle Dick, welcome Auntie Alice.&#8221; She had
      said it faultlessly three times already when approaching wheels started
      them to their feet expectantly. They were disappointed by seeing a
      neighbor drive round the bend in the lane. When the familiar bays did come
      into view with their swinging trot, Jilly was so enchanted she started off
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_225"></a>225</span>pell mell to
      meet them, spilling her blossoms out generously as she ran. The girls
      overtook her before she quite got in the path of the horses and reminded
      her of her responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton pulled up and Dick leaped to the ground, punctuating her
      attempted &#8220;Weecome&#8221; by tossing her into the air and kissing
      her noisily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jilly struggled free. Her coaching had not been in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oo muttant&#8211;I ain&#8217;t said it, and oo pillin&#8217; ve
      fowers.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick set the mite on her feet with exaggerated courtesy. &#8220;Of course&#8211;to
      be sure. I beg your most humble pardon, Miss.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jilly drew in a long breath and began at the beginning again. She plunged
      a fat hand into the market basket and aimed two hollyhock tops in the
      general direction of Dick&#8217;s diaphragm, repeating impressively:
      &#8220;Wee-come, Unky Dick.&#8221; She took no notice of his profound bow,
      but looking up at Alice, who was leaning out the side of the seat watching
      with amused eyes, she showered another handful upon the wheels and horses
      hoofs impartially. &#8220;Wee-come, An-tee Alish,&#8221; she said
      solemnly, then, with a rapturous look of triumph, turned to the girls for
      approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got it, with numerous hugs and kisses for interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_226"></a>226</span>Dick surveyed
      the remainder of the reception committee critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little, I hate to mention it, but is there anything left on
      the ranch to eat? I have been a little nervous all the time we have been
      away, remembering the execution Katy and Gertie and Sherm were doing when
      we left and now&#8212;&#8221; He gazed sorrowfully at the girls&#8217;
      plump cheeks. &#8220;I know they have gained ten pounds apiece. Be frank
      with me, Jane, is there anything left?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If there isn&#8217;t, Dick, you might commandeer one of Chicken
      Little &amp; Co.&#8217;s pigs. They are fat enough to sustain you for a
      few hours,&#8221; replied Dr. Morton, glancing at the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy and Jane also exchanged glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick was quite overcome when he caught sight of the triumphal arch and the
      flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Support me, Chicken Little, this reception is so, ah, flattering it
      makes me faint with emotion. Young ladies, Dr. Morton,&#8221; he placed
      one hand over his heart and bowed low to each, &#8220;and esteemed&#8212;&#8221;
      he hesitated, not seeing anyone but Jilly to include in this last
      salutation, &#8220;esteemed fellows,&#8221; he bowed once more, including
      trees, bushes, and any other objects handy, with a courtly sweep of the
      arm, &#8220;it is with deepest gratitude I&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Heart-felt sounds better, Dick,&#8221; interrupted Alice, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_227"></a>227</span>Dick gazed at
      her reproachfully. &#8220;&#8217;Tis always the way when I try to soar, my
      wife seizes my kite by the tail and pulls it down with a jerk. I thought
      lovely woman was supposed to inspire a man to higher&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick was interrupted in the middle of his complaining by Mrs. Morton&#8217;s
      coming out to greet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next few days fairly flew by. Each member of both families had thought
      of a variety of things that Alice and Dick must do before they went home.
      Unfortunately, there were only twenty-four hours in a day and it seemed
      necessary to spend part of these in sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We ought to have at least one more hunting party,&#8221; declared
      Chicken Little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We ought&#8211;I shall feel the lack of that hunting party for
      years to come, Jane. There will be a vacuum in my inner consciousness. I
      shall wake up in the middle of the night sighing for that hunting party.
      But you see to-day is Wednesday, and we must leave Friday, and Frank and I
      have sworn by every fish in the creek to take to-morrow off for a fishing
      trip. Chicken Little, there is only one way out of the dilemma. Painful as
      it will be for you, you&#8217;ll have to invite us to come again.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst of it was that Frank firmly declined to take a single petticoat
      along. Neither Marian nor Alice could move him from this ungallant
      resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_228"></a>228</span>&#8220;My
      dear wife,&#8221; Frank replied, &#8220;I love you, but I don&#8217;t love
      to have you round when I&#8217;m fishing.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Marian with decision, &#8220;if we can&#8217;t
      go we won&#8217;t get them any lunch. Will we, Mother Morton?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton was rather horrified at such a breach of hospitality, Dick and
      Sherm being included in the boycott, but Marian and Alice both urged, and
      she finally promised neither to get up a lunch herself nor to permit Annie
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian and Alice looked triumphant. Frank motioned to Dick and the two
      promptly disappeared. Marian quickly followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The villain! He&#8217;s gone over home to confiscate that batch of
      doughnuts I baked this morning. I hope he doesn&#8217;t find them.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton took the hint and locked up her pies and cake. But the two
      boys and Dr. Morton had joined the foraging party and food disappeared
      most mysteriously at intervals during the remainder of the day. A custard
      pie already cut and served on plates on the kitchen table, reassembled
      itself in the pie tin and walked out of the kitchen door when Annie
      changed the plates in the dining room. One entire loaf of bread vanished
      from the earth while Annie was trying to expel Ernest from the kitchen
      with a broom.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_229"></a>229</span>The foragers
      were so capable that even Mrs. Morton ceased to worry about the men folks
      going hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Marian&#8217;s blood was up. &#8220;We&#8217;ve just got to do
      something to get even. The best pool for fish on the whole creek is on
      Captain Clarke&#8217;s land and I know they are not going there. Let&#8217;s
      take the spring wagon and drive over and get the Captain to go fishing
      with us. He&#8217;ll take us to his own pool and with him to help, I&#8217;d
      be willing to wager we can beat these top-lofty fishermen at their own
      game.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice and the girls were instantly enthusiastic, but Mrs. Morton preferred
      to stay at home and keep cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian and Chicken Little left the others to put up the lunch, while they
      went out to the stable to hitch up the bays. They were soon on their way,
      with a can of bait and a pocket full of fish hooks and stout cord to rig
      up impromptu fishing lines, the men having taken all the poles with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others had gone soon after daybreak. It was nearing ten when Marian
      drove up to the Captain&#8217;s hitching post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What if he isn&#8217;t at home?&#8221; said Chicken Little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He&#8217;s got to be,&#8221; laughed Marian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wing Fan came out, grinning. He did not share his master&#8217;s reputed
      dislike for ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_230"></a>230</span>He ushered
      them all into the big library and went off to notify the Captain, who was
      down in the meadow superintending the hay cutting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am afraid we are an awful nuisance, but my prophetic soul tells
      me he will enjoy the joke and be pleased to have us come to him.&#8221;
      Marian was bolstering up her courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Of course he will. You don&#8217;t suppose anybody could resist
      this crowd, do you?&#8221; Alice encouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke was both pleased and amused. They were so excited they all
      talked at once, and it took several minutes for him to get command of the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They have the advantage in fishing early in the day, but I&#8217;ll
      impress Wing Fan and we&#8217;ll have more fish, if I have to get out a
      net and seine them. We&#8217;ll go down to the long hole now and see what
      we can do, and Wing will come as soon as he gives the men their dinner. If
      there is a fish in the creek you can depend on Wing to lure him. He just
      goes out and crooks his little finger and they begin to hunt for the hook,&#8221;
      he explained to Gertie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain proved to be an expert fisherman himself. He showed them all
      his little stock of fisherman&#8217;s tricks and they had a good catch by
      noon when Marian and Alice stopped to prepare the lunch. About two o&#8217;clock
      Wing Fan appeared, his face one broad, yellow smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_231"></a>231</span>&#8220;Big
      missee and little missee have most,&#8221; he assured them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little and Katy and Gertie laid off and perched some distance up
      the bank behind Wing to watch his methods. He didn&#8217;t seem to do
      anything different, but the fish certainly came to his hook in a most
      astonishing manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fished until four, and the catch exceeded their wildest expectations.
      They wanted to leave some with the Captain, but he wouldn&#8217;t hear of
      it. &#8220;If the men have more than you, you can send me some of theirs.
      I should like to see if the flavor is better.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They expected their fishermen to drift in about five, and knew they would
      bring their fish to the house to display them before taking them down to
      the spring stream. Hurrying home, they put away the team and took their
      fish down to the spring house. Captain Clarke had saved a considerable
      part of their take alive for them, in a wooden cask, which Wing carefully
      loaded into the spring wagon. They got a piece of chicken wire and
      fastened it across the opening where the water flowed out underneath the
      spring house, and then, removing the milk and butter crocks from the
      rock-lined channel, turned all the living fish into the water. The others
      they spread out on the rock floor to make the best showing possible. The
      spring house seemed alive with fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_232"></a>232</span>&#8220;They&#8217;ll
      never beat that!&#8221; Alice&#8217;s eyes were dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how they can.&#8221; Marian chuckled. &#8220;My
      lofty spouse will have to come down off his high horse this time.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t breathe a word, girls. I don&#8217;t want them to have
      the least inkling of what we have been up to, till they see this array.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fishermen arrived, hot, dusty, and hungry. After all their efforts,
      their supplies had hardly kept pace with their appetites. They displayed
      their booty proudly. Frank had three trout and five catfish on his string.
      Dick, one trout, and three catfish. Dr. Morton and the boys had pooled
      theirs, and boasted twelve altogether. But most of the fish were small.
      The ladies obligingly went into ecstasies over their skill. Chicken Little
      and Katy admired and ohed and ahed until Marian was afraid they would
      rouse suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you want them all here at the house or shall we put part of them
      down at the spring?&#8221; Frank asked, with emphasis on the all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, since there are so many, perhaps you&#8217;d better put some
      away for breakfast,&#8221; Marian replied, after an instant&#8217;s
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank, Dick and the boys started for the spring. The three girls rose to
      accompany them. Alice and Marian looked languidly uninterested.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_233"></a>233</span>The spring
      house was very dark and shadowy, coming in from the bright sunshine
      outside. Frank was in the lead. He stopped just in time to avoid stepping
      on a fish. He and Dick got their eyes focused to take in the display at
      almost the same instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be darned!&#8221; Frank looked at Dick in wild
      amaze. Dick stared, speechless, for fully twenty seconds. Then he broke
      into a roar. The boys, a few paces behind them, rushed in to see what the
      fun was. Ernest took one good look over Frank&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;Jumping
      Jehosaphat!&#8221; he ejaculated, making room for Sherm. Sherm gazed his
      fill and glanced at Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick came to first and hazarded a guess. &#8220;The ladies&#8211;God bless
      &#8217;em&#8211;they&#8217;ve been to town and bought out a market.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Nonsense, there isn&#8217;t a fish market in the burg&#8211;men
      sometimes peddle fish round at the houses, but they never get out here.
      They&#8217;ve been fishing on their own hook.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick turned on Chicken Little, who was watching them demurely. &#8220;If
      you don&#8217;t tell us how you worked this I&#8217;ll&#8212;&#8221; He
      advanced threateningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Fished,&#8221; she replied laconically. And neither coaxing nor
      threats extracted any further information from the ladies that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_234"></a>234</span>After supper
      Marian remarked carelessly: &#8220;Frank, there are more fish than we can
      use, don&#8217;t you think it would be nice to send some over to the
      Captain?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was Marian herself who finally let the cat out of the bag the
      following morning just before Alice and Dick left. The train would not
      leave until evening, but they were all going in to make a tour of the
      Indian remains and to do some shopping. Frank was driving for the guests
      and Marian; the youngsters were with the Captain. Marian reached down
      under the seat to push a satchel out of the way of her feet, and to her
      surprise, came in painful contact with a fish hook. She pulled up a bunch
      of line and several hooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I wondered what became of our lines,&#8221; she said
      carelessly. &#8220;Wing must have put them in for us.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up to find both Dick and Frank regarding her with interest and
      Alice looking reproachful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Methinks,&#8221; remarked Dick, gazing at the heavens thoughtfully,
      &#8220;I see a great light.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I knew they&#8217;d let it out,&#8221; Frank replied meanly.
      &#8220;Women are clever, but a secret is too many for them every time.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was cloudy but sultry. Collars wilted and little damp spots
      appeared between their shoulder <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_235"></a>235</span>blades if they ventured to lean against the
      backs of the seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaves were curling in the corn fields; the prairies were parched with the
      heat. Frank got out and examined several of the ears of corn just heading
      out in a field they passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked sober when he returned. &#8220;Forty-eight hours more like
      to-day will finish that field. It&#8217;s a trifle better on the bottom
      lands.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian and Alice scanned the heavens. &#8220;That cloud bank off to the
      south looks hopeful,&#8221; said Marian after several minutes&#8217;
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it was the weather or their unusual exertions of the preceding day
      or the menace of the drouth, that weighed upon them, it would be hard to
      say, but their interest in the Old Mission and the Indian mound on the
      Cook place was languid. Perhaps Ernest had been right when he declared
      that they were more interesting to hear about than to see. &#8220;It looks
      just like other houses, only the walls are thicker and the stone chimneys
      go clear down to the ground outside!&#8221; Katy exclaimed, distinctly
      disappointed at the appearance of the one-time fort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Of course, it was just a schoolhouse. They used it for a fort
      because it was stronger than any of the other houses, and, being all of
      stone, the Indians couldn&#8217;t set it on fire so easy.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian mound looked as if somebody had <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_236"></a>236</span>made a nice symmetrical sand pile about twenty
      feet high out in the middle of the prairie and then grassed it over
      neatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If we could cut into it after the fashion of a birthday cake,&#8221;
      said Captain Clarke, &#8220;you would find some very interesting things
      inside, I imagine, weapons and iron utensils. I should think Mr. Cook
      would take the trouble to explore it some day.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I guess he isn&#8217;t interested in anything unless he sees a
      dollar close by,&#8221; Ernest replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had dinner at the one decently kept hotel in Garland, and scattered
      along the comfortable veranda afterwards to rest and cool off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest pointed out the place near the top of the bluff where a dark spot
      in the rocky ledge revealed the location of the hermit&#8217;s cave.
      &#8220;Who is ready for the climb?&#8221; he asked, rejoining the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I pass,&#8221; said Dick from the depths of a willow porch chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And I,&#8221; Marian echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am just dying to go, Ernest, but it wouldn&#8217;t be proper for
      me to desert my liege Lord.&#8221; Alice shot a mischievous glance at the
      occupant of the willow chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t think of leaving our guests,&#8221; Frank stopped
      smoking long enough to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Put it to a vote, Ernest, and save us the trouble of inventing
      excuses,&#8221; remarked the Captain dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_237"></a>237</span>&#8220;Resolved&#8211;That
      we stay right where we are until train time. All in favor&#8212;&#8221; He
      was not permitted to continue. A chorus of &#8220;Ayes&#8221; drowned him
      out, the Captain leading.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they stayed until train time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What is it,&#8221; queried Ernest as they started homeward, &#8220;about
      a railroad train that makes one so crazy to go along?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Is it the train, or merely your love of adventure?&#8221; suggested
      Captain Clarke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I think it&#8217;s because a train always seems so&#8211;oh, jolly&#8211;and
      exciting,&#8221; ventured Katy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s only part,&#8221; said Chicken Little, who had been
      studying; &#8220;it&#8217;s wondering what&#8217;s at the other end of the
      track that tempts you so.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Pooh, I know what&#8217;s at the other end of this track and it
      tempts me like sixty.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Home?&#8221; Katy and Jane asked together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, supper!&#8221;

    <h2>
      CHICKEN LITTLE AND ERNEST
    </h2>
    <p>
      The household was awakened in the middle of the night by peals of thunder
      and the rush of rain against the windows. Chicken Little was drenched
      before she could get the window down next their bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; she said, as she hunted out a dry gown,
      &#8220;it&#8217;s raining and Ernest can go to college.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They slept late the following morning. The rain was coming down in a
      steady, business-like way that gladdened the heart of every farmer on the
      creek. Dr. Morton was jubilant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;This will save the corn and make thousands of dollars difference in
      the hay yield in the country,&#8221; he remarked at the breakfast table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t like about farming,&#8221; said
      Ernest. &#8220;So much depends on things that you can&#8217;t <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_239"></a>239</span>help. A man can
      work like a dog, and along comes a drouth or chinch bugs or too much rain
      during the haying season and, presto, all his fond hopes are knocked sky
      high.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well,&#8221; replied his father, &#8220;I guess there are mighty
      few businesses or professions where you don&#8217;t have to take chances.
      By the way, Son, I&#8217;m beginning to be afraid your hopes of Annapolis
      may be disappointed. I don&#8217;t understand why Senator Pratt ignores my
      letter this way.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I forgot to tell you, Father, Captain Clarke heard at the hotel
      yesterday that Senator Pratt has been seriously ill for several weeks, but
      they&#8217;ve been keeping it quiet. They say he&#8217;s just beginning to
      take up his affairs again.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We may hear then in a day or two. I believe I&#8217;ll go to town
      to-day&#8211;it&#8217;s too wet to do any work.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The day dragged for the young people indoors. They tried dominoes and
      authors, but the boys soon found these tame and settled down by themselves
      to chess as more worthy of a masculine intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain ceased and the sun came out about two o&#8217;clock. Gertie was
      in the midst of a letter home, but Katy and Chicken Little hurried
      outdoors into the moist, fresh air joyfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s go get some of those summer sweetings. I&#8217;m hungry
      for an apple. My, doesn&#8217;t the air taste good?&#8221; Chicken Little
      was taking deep breaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_240"></a>240</span>They picked
      their way daintily to avoid the wet weeds and high grass. The sky once
      more serene, receded in deep bays above the arches of foliage. Every now
      and then a bird, startled by their coming, flew out from the branches
      overhead, sending down showers of drops on their hair and shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found the sweeting tree and Chicken Little soon had an apron full. It
      was too wet to linger and they had started back, when Chicken Little
      stopped still and made a wry face. &#8220;Katy Halford, we haven&#8217;t
      fed those pigs!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No sir, we haven&#8217;t!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Say, this would be an awful good time to do it&#8211;everything&#8217;s
      so wet, we could loosen one of the stones easy. And I guess they&#8217;ll
      do the rest fast enough.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If we don&#8217;t give &#8217;em much to eat they&#8217;ll want to
      get out worse.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The days since Alice&#8217;s and Dick&#8217;s coming had been so full they
      had found no opportunity to carry out Jane&#8217;s scheme for ridding
      themselves gracefully of their burdensome boarders. Katy had explained the
      plan to Gertie, who heartily endorsed it. She went back to the house after
      her now, while Chicken Little began scouting to see if there were anyone
      about. The coast seemed clear. Jim Bart had gone to look after the pasture
      fences, and Marian told her that Ernest and Sherm had taken the
      wheelbarrow and started to the south field after a load of <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_241"></a>241</span>watermelons.
      &#8220;They&#8217;ll be back in half an hour if you want them for
      anything, Jane.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane didn&#8217;t want them for anything: she merely wanted them safely
      out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sped back to the house. &#8220;Hurry, girls, everybody&#8217;s gone,
      and Marian&#8217;s putting Jilly to sleep in the bedroom on the other side
      of the cottage, so she won&#8217;t see us. I&#8217;ll go get the milk and
      those pea pods Annie saved.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy and Gertie undertook the feeding, while Chicken Little went to the
      tool house for pick and spade. The log pig pen was merely one corner of
      the big hog corral, fenced off for the benefit of the new litters to
      protect them from the older hogs. Stones had been securely embedded
      underneath the lowest rail to keep the pigs from burrowing out beneath.
      Chicken Little went into the corral and inspected these, carefully trying
      one or two with the pick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Here&#8217;s one that isn&#8217;t very big and it&#8217;s loose at
      one corner. Let&#8217;s try it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stone had been put there to stay and did not yield readily. Jane dug
      till she was tired, then Katy took a hand. Gertie had been posted as a
      sentinel where she could watch the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      They strained and tugged, but the stone was obstinate. Jane was getting
      red in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The old hateful&#8212;I&#8217;ll get it out or bust!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_242"></a>242</span>&#8220;Perhaps
      I can help you, Chicken Little.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls glanced up in dismay. Sherm stood there grinning. He had come
      back across lots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What you trying to do, anyhow? Have your pets been getting out?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to do but take Sherm into their confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Please promise you won&#8217;t tell, Sherm&#8211;they&#8217;d tease
      me to death if they know. But we&#8217;re sick of those pigs. I never want
      to lay eyes on a pig again. So we thought we&#8217;d just loosen a stone
      so they could get into the corral with the others and Father&#8217;d think
      they&#8217;d dug out themselves. Nobody can ever pick &#8217;em out from
      the others. They are every bit as big as old Whity&#8217;s pigs and Father
      turned them in two weeks ago.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm chuckled. &#8220;Mum&#8217;s the word. Hand over the pick and we&#8217;ll
      do such an artistic job that the porkers themselves will think they are
      responsible for the whole business. I don&#8217;t blame you. That&#8217;s
      not girl&#8217;s work!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The pigs rose to the occasion beautifully. The tiny opening called as
      loudly as a pile of corn. They continued the excavating so promptly and
      expeditiously that by the time Dr. Morton returned from town, every piglet
      had deserted its maternal ancestor and was joyously rooting for itself in
      the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_243"></a>243</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t
      see how those pigs got out,&#8221; said Dr. Morton disgustedly. &#8220;I
      thought that small pen was secure.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls listened attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They were there at four o&#8217;clock, I saw them,&#8221; Sherm
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I suppose the heavy rain loosened the earth and it was easy
      rooting.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Possibly,&#8221; said Sherm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident might have awakened more interest if the Doctor had not
      returned, bringing a fateful letter. The long-expected letter from Senator
      Pratt had come. He would be most happy to give Ernest the appointment
      immediately, if he thought he could pass the mental examinations. An extra
      examination was to be held on the 30th at Annapolis. He was sending a
      catalogue and some special literature as to the ground to be covered, by
      the same mail. He would, however, recommend that Ernest go immediately to
      some reputable physician and see if he could pass the physical
      examination. They had a naval surgeon there in Topeka, if he cared to
      incur the expense of a visit to the Capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest was so busy poring over the catalogue that he could hardly be
      induced to stop long enough to eat his supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m more afraid of the mathematics than anything else. I
      wonder if I couldn&#8217;t get Prof. Smith <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_244"></a>244</span>to coach me. I could study all week and go in
      Saturdays to recite.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The first thing to do is to get that doctor&#8217;s certificate. We&#8217;ll
      go to town to-morrow and have Dr. Hardy look you over, and if he doesn&#8217;t
      find anything suspicious, we&#8217;ll run down to Topeka to see the
      surgeon and call on the senator at the same time. I think I could go
      Monday.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire family held its breath or at least tried to, for the next few
      days. Mrs. Morton quite forgot how badly she had wanted Ernest to have an
      education, when she learned that he could only come home once a year, and
      then only for a short month. She sighed so much and was so distraught,
      that the family were almost afraid to rejoice with Ernest, when he came
      home jubilantly waving his physician&#8217;s certificate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Never mind, Mother, that surgeon may send me packing. Don&#8217;t
      worry till you are sure I&#8217;m going. Even if I am vouched for as up to
      the scratch physically, I may flunk, alas! Wouldn&#8217;t that be nice
      after Father had put up a lot of money to send me on? You&#8217;d be
      ashamed of me, Mother, you wouldn&#8217;t want to see me come home.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am not expecting you to fail, son,&#8221; said Dr. Morton,
      &#8220;though I wish we could have arranged matters sooner to give you
      more time for review. But with the exception of a little extra
      mathematics, <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_245"></a>245</span>the
      requirements are certainly no worse than for college entrance exams. And
      you&#8217;ve tested yourself out twice on those. Aren&#8217;t you glad I
      insisted on more geometry?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t need to come home if he does fail. He can visit
      some of our friends in Centerville till college opens. It would only be a
      few days,&#8221; Frank consoled him. &#8220;However, I am not expecting
      you to fail, old boy. I have always flattered myself that the Morton
      family are not lacking in brains, and you know how to study.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I most wish he would fail so he could come to see us. Mother would
      love to have him spend the Christmas vacations with us,&#8221; put in Katy
      naïvely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, Katy, I&#8217;d enjoy nothing better, but I&#8217;ve
      kinder set my heart on showing this naval outfit that a wild and woolly
      Kansan can measure up with some of those down-easters.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The naval surgeon confirmed Dr. Hardy&#8217;s judgment. The senator had
      been cordial, and after some questioning, said he would send Ernest&#8217;s
      name to the department immediately. He also gave him some helpful
      suggestions as to what subjects to put the emphasis on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two weeks seemed a pretty short time for preparation. Ernest thanked his
      lucky star that he had done a little studying through the summer in
      preparation for his college entrance, and was not rusty. <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_246"></a>246</span>The entire family
      waited on him and followed him round till Frank declared they would ruin
      the boy, if he didn&#8217;t get off soon. Chicken Little sadly neglected
      her guests whenever it was possible to hang round Ernest. But Ernest was
      so busy, she seldom had a word alone with him. The two were very dear to
      each other despite their occasional bickering, and Chicken Little was
      almost jealous of every one who came near him during those last few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ernest,&#8221; said his father the Saturday before his departure,
      &#8220;will you take one farewell turn at herding to-morrow? Jim Bart
      wants to get off for the day and I&#8217;d like to have the cattle clean
      off that stubble field. I think I will plow early and put it in winter
      wheat this year. I have promised to drive Mother and the girls to town to
      church in the morning. We are to have dinner with the parson and won&#8217;t
      be home until evening.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Ernest overtook Chicken Little coming up from the spring with
      the butter and cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Say, Sis, don&#8217;t you want to stay home and help me herd
      to-morrow? The girls wouldn&#8217;t mind this once.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d love it. We just haven&#8217;t had a good talk for
      ages&#8211;but I don&#8217;t know what Mother&#8217;ll say.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll fix Mother,&#8221; he answered confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, he whispered: &#8220;It&#8217;s all O. K.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Gee, I guess Mother&#8217;d give you the moon if she <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_247"></a>247</span>could, she feels so
      bad about having you go so far away.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Poor Mother, it&#8217;s mighty rough on her out here on the ranch.
      Say, Sis, I don&#8217;t mind if you want to wear some of my old truck
      to-day&#8211;we&#8217;ll just be down in the field and your riding skirt
      will be a nuisance in among the cattle.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a mighty concession for Ernest, who had a considerable share of
      his mother&#8217;s respect for the conventions. Chicken Little appreciated
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached up and gave him a big hug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be awful hard to have you go, Ernest.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest didn&#8217;t say anything in reply, but he squeezed his young
      sister tight, as if he were realizing himself that he was about to miss
      something precious from his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two were up early the next morning and off with the herd before the
      rest of the family were fairly through breakfast. Sherm was going in with
      the others to church. Annie had put up a lunch for Ernest and Jane; they
      did not expect to get back to the house until late afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was an August masterpiece, warm, but not too warm, with a fresh
      breeze blowing and shreds of blue haze lingering over the timber along the
      creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It has almost a fall feel,&#8221; said Chicken Little.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_248"></a>248</span>A brisk
      half-hour&#8217;s work, in which Huz and Buz took an active part,
      hindering rather more than helping in the cattle driving, was sufficient
      to transfer the herd from the pasture to the stubble field. Chicken Little
      was thankful she had discarded her skirt, for they had many a chase after
      refractory animals through the timber and underbrush. Calico and Caliph,
      being mustangs, seemed to enjoy the sport as much as their riders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Cricky, Caliph is almost human when it comes to heading off a
      steer, and he&#8217;s never done much cattle driving either. He must have
      inherited the range instinct.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Humph, what about Calico?&#8221; retorted Jane. &#8220;He turned
      that roan Father always says is so mean, three times.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cattle scattered over the stubble eagerly. Ernest picketed the ponies
      so they could graze after their good work and he and Chicken Little threw
      themselves down under a red bud tree near the edge of the field to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They won&#8217;t stray much till they get their stomachs full,&#8221;
      said Ernest, &#8220;and that won&#8217;t be before afternoon. I brought a
      book along&#8211;Cooper&#8217;s &#8216;Naval History.&#8217; It&#8217;s
      great, though Father says it&#8217;s better romance than history. Do you
      mind if I read you a bit?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little backed up against a tree and settled <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_249"></a>249</span>herself comfortably
      and they were soon fighting with Paul Jones, so utterly absorbed that the
      herd had drifted down to the farther end of the field before they realized
      it. A half dozen adventurous beasts were already disappearing into the
      timber, apparently headed for the Captain&#8217;s cornfield, which lay
      just beyond the creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The pesky brutes! Why can&#8217;t they be content with a good
      square meal at home?&#8221; Ernest hated to be interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Perhaps they like to go visiting as much as we do. Besides, they
      don&#8217;t often have a chance at green corn.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      It took some time to recover the truants. By the time they were settled
      once more under the tree, the sun was nearing the zenith and they were
      growing hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s only half past eleven, but I&#8217;m starved. Let&#8217;s
      eat now.&#8221; Ernest eyed the packet of luncheon hungrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;All right, go fill the water jug, and I&#8217;ll get it out.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch they read for awhile, but, presently, the sun seemed to grow
      hotter and they commenced to feel drowsy. They decided to take turns
      watching the cattle and napping. The cattle also seemed to feel the heat
      and were hunting patches of shade, lying down to chew their cuds
      contentedly. The <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_250"></a>250</span>air
      seemed palpitating with the incessant humming and whirring of insects.
      Bees, and white and yellow butterflies flittered in a mat of weeds and
      wild blackberry vines, which had entirely covered an angle of the old rail
      fence near them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest&#8217;s nap was a long one. The boy had been studying hard for his
      examinations and was thoroughly tired. He was lying on his side, his face
      resting on his hand, and his old straw hat drawn over his face to keep off
      the flies. But the nagging insects soon discovered his neck and hands.
      Chicken Little fished his bandanna out of his pocket to protect his neck,
      covering the hand that lay on the grass with her own handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      He woke at length with a start, smiling up at Chicken Little when he
      discovered the handkerchiefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, Sis. Whew, I must have slept for keeps,&#8221; he added,
      glancing at the sun. &#8220;It&#8217;s four o&#8217;clock. The folks will
      be along about six.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up and took a survey of the field. The cattle were all quiet.
      Chicken Little was braiding little baskets with a handful of cat tail
      leaves she had brought from the slough. Ernest reached over and patted the
      busy fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sis, I&#8217;m mighty fond of you&#8211;do you know it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little looked up at him affectionately. &#8220;I suspected it,
      Ernest,&#8221; she answered demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_251"></a>251</span>The boy was
      going on with his own thoughts. &#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad to get away
      from the ranch. I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m cut out for this sort of
      thing. Guess, maybe, I&#8217;m not democratic enough&#8211;you remember
      that party at Jenkins&#8217;? Well, I&#8217;ve been thinking about it a
      good deal since. I guess Sherm sort of set me to thinking with his fuss
      about the kissing games. At any rate, I&#8217;ve made up my mind I don&#8217;t
      intend to be like any of the boys on this creek, and I don&#8217;t propose
      that you shall be like any of the girls if I can help it. It isn&#8217;t
      that they aren&#8217;t smart enough and good enough. The people round here
      are mighty touchy about one person&#8217;s being just as good as another.
      Maybe one person is born just as good as anybody else, but, thank
      goodness, they don&#8217;t all stay alike. I mayn&#8217;t be any better
      than the Craft boys, but I know I&#8217;m a sight cleaner, and I don&#8217;t
      murder the king&#8217;s English quite every other word, and I know enough
      to be polite to a lady. And if I take the trouble to make myself decent,
      and they don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t see any reason why I should be
      expected to pretend they&#8217;re as good as I am.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest was waxing wroth. The insistent equality of the Creek was on his
      nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if people do think I&#8217;m stuck up&#8211;I&#8217;m
      going to try to associate with the kind of people I like. It isn&#8217;t
      money&#8211;it&#8217;s just nice living. If it wasn&#8217;t for people
      like the Captain and one or two <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_252"></a>252</span>others we&#8217;d forget what lady and
      gentleman meant. And that isn&#8217;t saying that there aren&#8217;t lots
      of good kind people on the Creek, too. But they&#8217;re so dead satisfied
      with themselves the way they are&#8211;they don&#8217;t seem to know there
      is any better way to live.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was listening eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know what you mean. Lots of it&#8217;s little things. I noticed
      that night at the Jenkins&#8217;. Mamie&#8217;s prettier than me and the
      boys like her better, but I don&#8217;t want to be like her all the same.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I should think not, Chicken Little, and you needn&#8217;t worry.
      You&#8217;re nothing but a kid yet, but by the time you&#8217;re eighteen,
      Mamie Jenkins won&#8217;t hold a candle to you. And while I think of it,
      Sis, the less you see of Mamie the better. And I don&#8217;t want you
      playing any more kissing games&#8211;you&#8217;re too big.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Humph, you just said I was nothing but a kid. You&#8217;re as bad
      as Mother.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest was not to be diverted. &#8220;None of your dodging. I want you to
      promise me you won&#8217;t.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It isn&#8217;t that I want to play them,&#8221; she argued, &#8220;but
      if I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll have to sit and look on and all the old folks&#8217;ll
      ask me if I&#8217;m not well, and the girls&#8217;ll say I&#8217;m stuck
      up. It wasn&#8217;t as easy as you seem to think, Ernest Morton, but I&#8217;ll
      promise, if you&#8217;ll promise not to kiss any girl while you&#8217;re
      gone.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_253"></a>253</span>&#8220;Nonsense,
      Jane, you don&#8217;t understand. It&#8217;s different with a boy.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little fixed her brown eyes upon Ernest&#8217;s face musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;How is it different?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little Jane Morton, haven&#8217;t you had any raising? You
      know as well as I do it isn&#8217;t nice for a girl to let boys kiss her.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little considered. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t be so toploftical;
      girls don&#8217;t want most boys to kiss &#8217;em.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Most?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s what I said. I hated it when Grant kissed me at Mamie&#8217;s
      party, but I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d mind if Sherm&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She got no further. Ernest bristled with brotherly indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Has Sherm ever&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Of course not, Sherm wouldn&#8217;t! I guess it&#8217;s because I
      know he wouldn&#8217;t, that I shouldn&#8217;t much mind if he did.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little said this soberly, but her face grew a little red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest&#8217;s brotherly eyes were observant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, Sherm&#8217;s all right, but Sis, I want that promise.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I told you I&#8217;d promise if you would.&#8221; Chicken Little
      drew her lips together in a firm way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But I can&#8217;t&#8211;it would be silly&#8211;I might look <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_254"></a>254</span>ridiculous sometime
      if I refused. The fellows would guy me if they knew I made such a promise.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, I just told you they&#8217;d guy me if I refused to do what
      the others do.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But, Chicken Little, it isn&#8217;t nice.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I guess I know that as well as you do. And I don&#8217;t know that
      I shall ever play that kind of games again, but I&#8217;m not going to
      promise if you won&#8217;t. Boys don&#8217;t need to think they can do
      everything they want to, just because they&#8217;re boys. You don&#8217;t
      want anybody to kiss me, but I&#8217;d like to know how you are going to
      kiss a girl without making somebody else&#8217;s sister do something that
      isn&#8217;t nice, Ernest Morton.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The discussion ended there. Ernest was not very worldly wise himself, and
      Chicken Little&#8217;s reasoning was certainly logical.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had but little time to talk after that. The cattle began to roam
      restlessly once more and they were in the saddle pretty constantly for the
      remainder of the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest took the trouble to lift her down from Calico when they reached the
      stable that evening, an unusual attention. He also gave her a shy kiss on
      the cheek and whispered: &#8220;I&#8217;ll promise, Sis. I don&#8217;t
      know but you are about half right.&#8221;

    <h2>
      OFF TO ANNAPOLIS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &#8220;Golly, I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t have any fingers left by the time I
      finish this needle case! King&#8217;s excuse, Katy, you needn&#8217;t
      mind. I know I said it, but if you tried to push a needle through this
      awful leather and pricked yourself every other stitch you&#8217;d say
      Golly, too.&#8221; Chicken Little edged off as she saw Katy approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy was not to be deterred. &#8220;You said to pinch you every single
      time, Jane Morton, and you&#8217;ve said it twice. Besides, your mother
      said she hoped I could cure you.&#8221; Katy gave Chicken Little&#8217;s
      arm two vigorous pinches to emphasize this statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little did not take this kindly office in the spirit in which it
      was intended. She hated to sew and she had been toiling all morning on a
      little bronze leather case to hold needles, buttons, and pins&#8211;a
      parting gift to Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_256"></a>256</span>&#8220;Katy
      Halford, I told you not to! I think you are real mean to do it when I&#8217;m
      having such a hard time. I&#8217;ll thank you not to any more, if I do say
      it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to go and get mad! You told me to.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, and I just now told you not to!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I guess you&#8217;d say King&#8217;s excuse every time if I&#8217;d
      let you. A lot of good it&#8217;s going to do, if you sneak out of it
      whenever you want to.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t sneak out of it&#8211;this is the very first time,
      and you know it!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know any such thing, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s
      very good manners to be telling your guests they&#8217;re saying something
      that isn&#8217;t so! The day before they&#8217;re going home, too!&#8221;
      Katy forgot the dignity of her fifteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, I think it&#8217;s quite as good manners as to tell your
      friends they&#8217;re sneaks!&#8221; Jane&#8217;s tone was icy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertie came between the belligerents. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t quarrel,
      girls. It&#8217;d be dreadful the very last day, after we have had such a
      beautiful summer. I never did have such a good time in all my life. I most
      wish I could live on a ranch always.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t like to live on a ranch, but we have had a jolly
      time, Chicken Little,&#8221; Katy recovered herself enough to say
      graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_257"></a>257</span>Chicken
      Little was not to be outdone. &#8220;I suppose I was ugly, Katy. It always
      makes me cross to sew. I wish nobody had ever invented needles. O dear, I
      shall be as lonesome as pie when you are gone. It isn&#8217;t much fun
      being the only girl on the ranch, I tell you. Sometimes, I don&#8217;t
      even see another girl for weeks.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But your school begins soon, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;ll have Sherm. I just don&#8217;t believe I could
      bear to have Ernest go if Sherm wasn&#8217;t going to stay.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m awful glad Mr. Lenox put off coming for another day so we
      can go on the same train with Ernest.&#8221; Katy had been exulting over
      this for the past twenty-four hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ernest will be on the train for three days. I feel as if he would
      be as far away as if he were going to China.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Their conversation was interrupted by Mrs. Morton&#8217;s entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Would you rather have chocolate or cocoanut cake for your lunch,
      girls? Annie has killed three chickens, and I thought you could take a
      basket of those big yellow peaches; I only wish I could send some to your
      mother. And I&#8217;ll put in cheese and cold-boiled ham and a glass of
      current jelly. Mr. Lenox may want to get a meal or two at the stations,
      but you are so hurried at these&#8211;and it&#8217;s always well <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_258"></a>258</span>to have plenty of
      lunch in traveling. Dr. Morton told Ernest that he&#8217;d better get all
      his breakfasts at the eating houses to have something hot. And by the
      third day his lunch will be too stale&#8211;even if there is any left.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest was creepy with excitement between joy at going and his haunting
      fear that he might disgrace the family by failing to pass the
      examinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Buck up, old chap,&#8221; Frank admonished, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got
      facts enough in your head if you can only get them out at the right time.
      My advice is to forget all about exams and enjoy your trip. One doesn&#8217;t
      go to Washington and Baltimore every day. You ought to have several hours
      in St. Louis if your train is on time. Be sure to eat three square meals
      every day and keep yourself as fresh as you can and I&#8217;ll back you to
      pass any fair test.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If you have time in St. Louis I want you to be sure to go and see
      Shaw&#8217;s Gardens. They used to be wonderful and they must have been
      greatly improved since I saw them,&#8221; said Mrs. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each individual member of the Morton family, except Jilly and Huz and Buz,
      took Ernest aside for a parting chat with advice and remembrances. Jilly
      and the dogs secured their share by getting in the way as often as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little had her turn first. She tendered the needle case
      doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_259"></a>259</span>&#8220;Mother
      said you would have to sew on your own buttons at the Academy and that you&#8217;d
      find this mighty handy, but I&#8217;d loathe to have anybody give me such
      a present. And, Ernest, here&#8217;s the five dollars I got last birthday.
      You take it and buy something you really want.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest demurred about accepting the money, but Jane insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Little Sis, you&#8217;re sure a dear&#8212;&#8221; Ernest found
      himself choking up most unaccountably. He gave her a good old-fashioned
      hug in conclusion to save himself the embarrassment of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton took his son into the parlor and closed the door immediately
      after dinner. They stayed an hour, during which time the Doctor gave
      Ernest much practical advice about his conduct and sundry warnings not to
      be extravagant or careless in handling his money. No sooner had they
      emerged, Ernest looking important and rather dazed, when his mother laid
      her hand upon his arm, saying: &#8220;My son, I also wish to have a little
      talk with you. We shall be hurried in the morning so perhaps we would
      better have it now.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest returned to the parlor with his mother. Chicken Little lay in wait
      outside in the hall. She and Katy had a beautiful plan for a last boat
      ride that afternoon. She knew Ernest would be going over to say good-bye
      to the Captain anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_260"></a>260</span>Chicken
      Little waited and yawned and waited and squirmed for a solid hour and a
      quarter. The steady hum of her mother&#8217;s voice was interrupted
      occasionally by brief replies from Ernest. At last, Chicken Little heard a
      movement and roused herself joyously. But her mother began to speak again&#8211;this
      time with reverent solemnity. Chicken Little forgot herself and listened a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Umn, I guess she&#8217;s praying&#8211;they must be most through.
      Golly, I bet Ernest&#8217;s tired!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door opened a moment later there were tears on Mrs. Morton&#8217;s
      lashes and Ernest looked sober. He held a handsome Oxford bible in his
      hand. Mrs. Morton glanced at Jane suspiciously, but passed on into the
      sitting room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little surveyed her brother wickedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Did Mother give you a new bible?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yep.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I thought you had one.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Got two&#8211;Mother forgot, I s&#8217;pose.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Bet you&#8217;d rather have had a new satchel&#8211;that bible must
      have cost a lot.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I would, but don&#8217;t you dare let on to Mother. I wouldn&#8217;t
      hurt her feelings for a farm! She&#8217;s awful good, but she doesn&#8217;t
      understand how a fellow feels about things. I&#8217;d rather be licked any
      day than prayed over. I guess if I attended all the &#8216;means of grace&#8217;
      she wants me to, I wouldn&#8217;t have <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_261"></a>261</span>any time left for lessons. I&#8217;m going to
      try all-fired hard not to do anything to hurt Mother or make her ashamed
      of me, but I&#8217;m not calculating to wear out the pews at prayer
      meetings&#8211;not so you&#8217;d notice it.&#8221; Ernest grinned at
      Chicken Little defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane replied soberly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;A prayer meeting&#8217;s a real treat to Mother. She hasn&#8217;t
      had a chance to go to one for so long she is just pining for the
      privilege, but I bet she didn&#8217;t feel that way when she was young!
      But she thinks she did, so there&#8217;s no use fussing.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian&#8217;s admonition to Ernest was brief and to the point. She stood
      him up against the wall and looked him so squarely in the eyes that she
      could see her own reflection in the pupils. Ernest&#8217;s six feet of
      vigorous youth was good to look at. His hazel eyes gazed back at her
      steadfastly. Marian smiled up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ernest Morton, I&#8217;m downright proud to be your sister, and if
      you can look me in the eye as fearlessly and unashamed when you come home,
      I shall be still prouder. I want to tell you something I overheard in a
      store the other day about Father. Some men were evidently discussing him
      in connection with a business deal, and one remarked emphatically: &#8216;Old
      man Morton may have his weaknesses like the rest of us humans, but his
      word&#8217;s as good as his bond any day, and there&#8217;s precious few
      men you can say <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_262"></a>262</span>that
      of.&#8217; It&#8217;s worth while to have that sort of a father, Ernest,
      but it makes the Morton name somewhat of a responsibility to live up to,
      doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian gave him a pat and pulled his head down to kiss him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy and Gertie had been busy all day with their own preparations for
      departure. Marian was helping them with their packing, because Mrs. Morton
      had her hands full with the lunch and Ernest&#8217;s clothes and trunk.
      Chicken Little vibrated between the two centers of interest. Jilly also
      assisted, contributing articles of her own when she caught the spirit of
      packing. Her mother rescued a cake of soap and one of her shoes, but after
      Katy and Gertie arrived at home, they discovered one of Jilly&#8217;s
      nighties reposing on top of their Sunday hats and her rag doll neatly
      wedged in a corner of their trunk. Ernest was not overlooked either. When
      he unpacked at Annapolis, his recently acquired New York roommate was
      decidedly amazed to see him draw forth a small, pink stocking from the
      upper tray and a little later, a soiled woolly sheep along with his
      shirts. Ernest found his explanations about a baby niece received rather
      incredulously until a choice packet containing half a doughnut, a
      much-mutilated peach, two green apples, and a mud pie appeared. Jilly had
      evidently prepared a lunch for her uncle. They both went off into rumbles
      of mirth over this remarkable <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_263"></a>263</span>exhibit and began a friendship which was
      destined to be enduring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane&#8217;s boat ride scheme found favor, but Mrs. Morton declared they
      must put it off till after supper. They drove over and found the Captain
      smoking contentedly on the veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I was hoping you young people would come to-night,&#8221; he said,
      &#8220;though I intended going to the train to see you off in any event. I
      shall miss these young ladies sadly, and Ernest seems to belong to me a
      little, now that he has decided to be a sailor, too.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If I get in, I shall owe it to you, for I should never have thought
      of Annapolis if you hadn&#8217;t suggested it,&#8221; Ernest replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, I trust I have not influenced you to a decision you will some
      day regret. You seem to me to have many of the qualifications for a naval
      officer.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you think he is sufficiently qualified to row the <i>Chicken
      Little</i>, Captain Clarke?&#8221; asked Jane suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;If he isn&#8217;t, I think Sherm
      is. We might let the one who gets there first prove his skill.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys were not slow in acting upon this hint. They sprinted their best
      without waiting for a starter, and reached the skiff so exactly together
      that the question of precedence was still unsettled. The <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_264"></a>264</span>boys did not wait
      for an umpire. Ernest untied the boat and both attempted to fling
      themselves in with disastrous results. The <i>Chicken Little</i> had not
      been built for wrestling purposes. She tipped sufficiently to spill both
      boys into the creek. The water was shallow, but Sherm was wet well up to
      the waist, and Ernest, who had been pitched still farther out, was soaked
      from head to foot. They appeared ludicrously surprised and sheepish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls and the Captain laughed most unfeelingly. But Chicken Little
      immediately began to consider the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Poor Mother, she&#8217;ll have to dry that suit out and press it
      before it can be packed. It&#8217;s a blessed thing you didn&#8217;t wear
      your new suit as you wanted to, Ernest Morton.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My, but you are wet!&#8221; exclaimed Katy. &#8220;Oughtn&#8217;t
      you to go right home and change?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Come with me into the house, boys. I think Wing and I can fix you
      up.&#8221; The Captain cut a laugh in the middle to offer aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lads were so ludicrously crestfallen; they were doubly comical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wing, fortunately, had a good fire in the kitchen and soon had their wet
      garments steaming before it, while the Captain hunted out dry clothes for
      them. Some spirit of mischief prompted him to array Ernest in an old
      uniform of his own, with amazing <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_265"></a>265</span>results, for Ernest was considerably slimmer
      than the older man, and fully two inches taller. The ample blue coat with
      its gold braid hung on him as on a clothes rack. The sleeves were so short
      they left a generous expanse of wrist in view, and the trousers struck him
      well above the ankle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain saluted him ceremoniously, chuckling at the boy&#8217;s absurd
      appearance. The girls were openly hilarious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little struck an attitude. &#8220;Behold the future admiral!
      Ladies and gentlemen, permit me to introduce Admiral Morton, of whose
      distinguished exploits you have often heard. His recent feat of capsizing
      the enemy&#8217;s frigate single-handed, has never been equalled in the
      annals of our glorious navy.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not permitted to finish this speech undisturbed. Ernest had chased
      her half way round the house before she got the last words out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He clapped his hand firmly over her mouth to restrain her from further
      eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane struggled helplessly. &#8220;Katy&#8211;say, Katy, come&#8211;help&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy, nothing loath, flung herself on Ernest from the rear and the three
      had a joyous tussle, with honors on the side of the future admiral, till
      Sherm, who had been a little slower in dressing than Ernest, came out the
      front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_266"></a>266</span>Jane called
      to him despite the restraining hand and her shortening breath: &#8220;Sherm,
      he&#8217;s choking me&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Choking nothing&#8211;it&#8217;s Katy who is choking me&#8211;just
      wait till I get hold of you, Miss Halford!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy had both hands gripped fairly on his coat collar and was tugging
      Ernest backward with all her might, while Chicken Little struggled to get
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Come help,&#8211;Sherm, please!&#8221; Chicken Little loosened
      herself from the gagging hand enough to plead again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Keep out, Sherm. Three against one is no fair.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm watched the fray a moment, undecided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You may have bigger odds than that, Ernest,&#8221; laughed the
      Captain. &#8220;You might as well be getting your hand in.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm sauntered leisurely over and helped Chicken Little wrench loose,
      then, whispering something hastily, took her by the hand and they both
      made for the creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest, relieved of his sister, swung quickly round, catching Katy by the
      shoulders before she could save herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ve a mind to&#8212;&#8221; At this moment he detected Sherm&#8217;s
      game. &#8220;No, you don&#8217;t, smarties!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy likewise saw and acted even more quickly than Ernest. She was very
      light and swift, and she <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_267"></a>267</span>darted
      past Sherm and Chicken Little like a flash, reaching the boat twenty
      seconds ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Come on, Ernest!&#8221; She slipped the rope deftly from the post,
      not waiting to untie it, and, pushing off, leaped lightly into the row
      boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest needed no second invitation. Katy motioned to him to run farther
      along the bank and paddled the skiff in close enough for him to climb on
      board. Sherm and Chicken Little, dazed by the suddenness of this maneuver,
      were still some feet away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Katy Halford, you&#8217;re a pretty one to go back on your own side
      that way,&#8221; Jane scolded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Katy, I didn&#8217;t think it of you&#8211;after asking me to come
      and help you, too!&#8221; Sherm was also reproachful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask you, Sherman Dart. It was Chicken Little.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Of course,&#8221; Ernest encouraged. &#8220;Katy&#8217;s been on my
      side all the time. Haven&#8217;t you, Katy?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Katy nodded, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain, who had followed the young people at a more sober gait,
      smiled at this outcome of the skirmish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;When a woman will she will, you may depend upon it,&#8221; he
      quoted. &#8220;The trouble is to find out what she wills.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest, secure in the rower&#8217;s seat, could afford to <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_268"></a>268</span>be generous. He
      brought the boat in and took them all on board. Gertie had been a quiet
      spectator of the frolic. She had little taste for boisterous fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke handed her in with a flourish. &#8220;Gertie is my partner.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm had his revenge. Ernest rowed energetically&#8211;so energetically
      that he was tired enough to be willing to resign the oars before a half
      hour had gone by. Under the circumstances he did not quite like to ask
      Sherm to relieve him. Sherm seemed to be oblivious to the fact that it
      required energy to propel the boat. He was strumming an imaginary banjo as
      an accompaniment to the familiar melodies the girls were softly singing,
      occasionally joining in himself. Katy did not fail to observe that Ernest
      dropped one of his oars to regard a blister ruefully, and she did her best
      to help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Say, Ernest, let me try one oar. I believe I could row with you if
      you would take shorter strokes.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernest hadn&#8217;t much faith in Katy&#8217;s skill, but the experiment
      gave him an excuse to rest a minute. He moved over and handed her the oar
      with a little smile of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;re a trump, Katy,&#8221; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness dropped softly in the timber. They heard a distant splash where a
      muskrat had taken to the water. Every one wished solemnly by the evening
      star. And two of the wishes came true in record <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_269"></a>269</span>time. The Captain
      wished that he might find the son so long lost to him. Katy wished&#8211;she
      didn&#8217;t quite put the wish into words&#8211;but she did want Ernest
      to have what he wanted. One by one the other stars twinkled forth and the
      darkness deepened till their faces were dim, white blurs, and the girls&#8217;
      pink-and-blue dresses faded into patches of dusk in the blackness.
      Fireflies winked in the gloom. At the Captain&#8217;s suggestion, Katy and
      Ernest rested on their oars. They stopped singing and listened to the
      night&#8217;s silences&#8211;silences broken by rustling movements from a
      thicket on the farther bank or by eery creakings of the branches overhead.
      The little group felt vaguely the bigness of things, though no one but the
      Captain knew exactly why.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ten o&#8217;clock before they went back to the house. Wing had
      performed a miracle in the meantime; the boy&#8217;s suits were not only
      dried, but neatly pressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton let them all sleep late the next morning in view of the long
      journey ahead for Ernest and the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Sherm found this last day trying. His father&#8217;s health was not
      improving and a fear lay close in his heart that he should never see him
      again. It was almost more than he could bear to hear the girls talk about
      going home. He eased the ache by keeping at work. Dr. Morton had already
      initiated <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_270"></a>270</span>him
      into Ernest&#8217;s duties. The others were too busy to think much about
      Sherm but Chicken Little, who sat beside him at the table, noticed that he
      scarcely tasted his dinner. She started to remark about it, but a glance
      at Sherm&#8217;s drawn face warned her in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, she had a gracious thought. &#8220;Sherm, let&#8217;s ride
      Caliph and Calico in to the train, then the others won&#8217;t be so
      crowded and Marian and Jilly can go, too.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm somehow felt better immediately. The brisk gallop they took at
      starting helped still more. Sunflowers and golden rod lined the roadside
      for miles; brown cat tails nodded above the swales. A bobolink, swaying on
      a weed stalk near by, answered Sherm&#8217;s chirrup to the ponies with a
      volley of golden notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little,&#8221; he remarked, apropos of nothing, after they
      had ridden a few miles, &#8220;you are a mighty comfortable person to have
      &#8217;round.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Maybe you won&#8217;t think so in a day or two. I shall be so
      lonesome I may be tempted to follow you about like Huz and Buz.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You can&#8217;t scare me that way, Chicken Little, I think the
      ranch is going to be a pretty loose fit for all of us for a few days. But
      your school begins about the middle of September, doesn&#8217;t it? That
      will help.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_271"></a>271</span>&#8220;Yes, I
      wish you were going to school, too. Say, Sherm, why couldn&#8217;t you
      arrange to take one or two special studies under the new teacher? They say
      he only lacks one year of graduating from college and knows a lot. He&#8217;s
      teaching to save the money for his last year. Perhaps you might take some
      of your freshman work.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I wish I could&#8211;I hate to get behind the rest of the boys. But
      your father is hiring me to work, not to study.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know, but when winter comes you won&#8217;t need to work all the
      time, and you&#8217;ll have all your evenings&#8211;Jim Bart does.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If I could only keep up my mathematics and Latin, I wouldn&#8217;t
      be losing so much.&#8221; Sherm was considering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nine-mile ride to town seemed shorter than usual to most of the party
      that afternoon. Ernest, in spite of his joy in actually going away to
      school, found home and home folk unexpectedly dear now that he was leaving
      them for many months. Poor Mrs. Morton could hardly tear her eyes from the
      son who was taking his first step away from her. Chicken Little was
      feeling disturbingly sober; no Ernest, no Katy, no Gertie&#8211;how could
      she ever stand it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherm, if I start to cry, just wink, will you&#8211;that funny way
      you do sometimes. Ernest bet I <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_272"></a>272</span>would&#8211;and I won&#8217;t, but I know I&#8217;m
      going to want to dreadfully.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was as good as her word. She didn&#8217;t&#8211;that is, as
      long as Ernest could see her. She kissed him good-bye and gave him a
      playful box on the ear. She threw kisses, smiling as the group at the car
      window slid by, then the lump in her throat grew startlingly bigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Race you to the horses, Chicken Little,&#8221; said Sherm. &#8220;If
      it&#8217;s all right with you, Mrs. Morton, we&#8217;ll go straight home.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little raced with Sherm and with her tears. She beat Sherm but the
      tears won out. She could hardly see to untie Calico&#8217;s rein. Sherm
      took the strap out of her hand, fastened it, and swung her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Shut your eyes and open your mouth,&#8221; he commanded, as soon as
      she was securely seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane obeyed meekly and Sherm popped a big chocolate drop in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed, smiling through the trickling tears,
      &#8220;was that what you stopped down town for? My, what a baby you must
      think me!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm reached over and patted her hand. &#8220;I think you are several
      pumpkins and some squash, Chicken Little. Have another?&#8221;

      SCHOOL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The days crawled by during the next two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I hate them so by night, I want to shove them off into to-morrow by
      main force,&#8221; Jane told Marian complainingly, the third day after
      Ernest and the girls had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;ll be all right in a day or two. It&#8217;s always
      hardest at first,&#8221; Marian consoled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I suppose it doesn&#8217;t make any difference whether I&#8217;m
      all right or all wrong&#8211;the folks have gone just the same.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And you might as well make the best&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, yes, I might as well! &#8216;Count your blessings, my brethren,
      etc.&#8217; I&#8217;ve done counted &#8217;em till I&#8217;m sick of
      hearing about them! Marian, if you don&#8217;t find me something new to do
      I shall bust!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_274"></a>274</span>Marian was
      particularly busy that morning and not so patient as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waved her hand around the room ironically. &#8220;I shall be charmed,
      Chicken Little, will you finish these dishes or sweep the sitting room or
      sew on that dress of Jilly&#8217;s? I can furnish you an endless variety
      to choose from.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I said something new.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Jilly&#8217;s dress is brand spanking new.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You know what I mean.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I know, Jane, I have had the feeling myself, but I don&#8217;t
      imagine the heavens are going to open and shower down something new and
      choice on you because you&#8217;re lonesome and bored. If you can&#8217;t
      amuse yourself, you might as well be useful and have something to show for
      a tedious day.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little drummed on the window for several minutes without replying,
      then swung round with a grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Hand over the dress&#8211;I can run up the seams on the machine all
      right, I suppose.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The family waited, excited and expectant, for the report on Ernest&#8217;s
      examinations. They had had a long letter telling of his journey and safe
      arrival. Katy and Gertie and Mrs. Halford had each written long letters
      full of Centerville news and references to their pleasant summer. Mrs.
      Halford could not say enough concerning the girls&#8217; improved
      appearance. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_275"></a>275</span>Katy
      wrote the most interesting item. &#8220;What do you think? Carol Brown
      left for Annapolis, too. Do you suppose Ernest will know him? P. S. We
      showed him your picture and he stared at it awful hard and said&#8211;you&#8217;ve
      got to get me a trade last for this&#8211;&#8216;Say, Chicken Little&#8217;s
      going to be a hummer if she keeps on!&#8217; Don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;m
      nice to tell you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane gave the letter to Sherm to read, forgetting this part. Sherm snorted
      when he came to it, glancing up curiously at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you like that sort of stuff, Chicken Little?&#8221; he asked
      later.
    </p>
    <hr style="border:none; border-bottom:1px solid silver; height: 1px; width: 80%; text-align: center; margin: 10px auto;" />
    <p>
      It was almost two weeks after Ernest went, before Dr. Morton, on his
      return from town one September evening, came up the walk excitedly waving
      a telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Chicken Little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He must have passed or Father wouldn&#8217;t look so pleased,&#8221;
      said Mrs. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came in slightly breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, Mother, I&#8217;m afraid you have lost your boy.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton looked startled for a moment, then, reassured by her husband&#8217;s
      smile, fumbled nervously for her glasses to read the yellow paper he
      handed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_276"></a>276</span>She was
      maddeningly deliberate. Jane, perched upon the arm of her chair, tried to
      anticipate her, but her mother held it so she could not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s place to see it first, daughter.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Reproving Chicken Little steadied Mrs. Morton&#8217;s nerves, and she read
      the few words aloud with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sworn in to-day&#8211;hurrah!&#8221; Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That means that he&#8212;?&#8221; She looked inquiringly at her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That means he has passed both physical and mental examinations and
      has been regularly sworn in to Uncle Sam&#8217;s service.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But I thought he was just going to the Naval Academy&#8211;why does
      he have to be sworn in as if he were enlisting?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Because he, practically, has enlisted. He enters the government
      service when he enters the academy, and he simply takes his oath of
      allegiance.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton&#8217;s questioning was interrupted by the entrance of Sherm,
      Frank, and Marian, who came in demanding news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Mother,&#8221; said Frank, patting her shoulder,
      &#8220;your precious lamb is in good hands. He&#8217;ll be back next
      September such a dude the family won&#8217;t know how to behave in his
      presence.&#8221; Frank couldn&#8217;t resist teasing even when he tried to
      comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_277"></a>277</span>Mrs. Morton
      sighed. &#8220;A great many things can happen in a year.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Mother dear, they can, but most always they don&#8217;t. The
      only things you can depend on are bad weather and work.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter soon followed the telegram, giving details of the examinations,
      and a glimpse of Ernest&#8217;s new life, which comforted his mother,
      because he was forming punctual habits and had to go regularly to chapel
      whether he wished to or not. He had met Carol unexpectedly, to their
      mutual joy. &#8220;He&#8217;s an awfully handsome chap&#8211;knows it,
      too, but I think he has too much sense to let it spoil him. It&#8217;s
      jolly to have some one I know here,&#8221; Ernest wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      School began for Chicken Little at the little brown schoolhouse a mile
      distant, on the fifteenth of September. Chicken Little and the whole
      Morton family rejoiced, for she had been a most dissatisfied young person
      of late. Her mother watched her walk away down the lane, immaculate in her
      new flower-bordered calico, lunch basket in hand, with positive
      thankfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Glad to have her out of the way, aren&#8217;t you, Mother? Jane is
      too restless a girl to be idle,&#8221; laughed Marian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane had spoken to her father about her plan for Sherm and he had heartily
      agreed. But Sherm was <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_278"></a>278</span>not
      to begin until the first of November when the most pressing of the farm
      work would be over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little promptly talked the matter over also with the new teacher,
      Mr. Clay, a young man of twenty-one, fresh from his junior year at
      college. He was wide awake and attractive, and while ignorant, as they, of
      many of the niceties of polite society, seemed a very elegant being to the
      majority of his new pupils. Mamie Jenkins had concluded to stay at home
      for the fall term instead of going to the Garland High School. For some
      reason it took an astonishing number of consultations with the teacher to
      arrange Mamie&#8217;s course satisfactorily, especially when she learned
      that Sherm would be coming soon. She quizzed Chicken Little carefully as
      to what studies Sherm would take.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Geometry and Latin, I think. I asked Mr. Clay and he said he could.
      Maybe bookkeeping, too.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I was just thinking I ought to go on with my Latin. I had Beginning
      Latin last year, and I really ought to take Cæsar right away before I
      forget.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane regarded her thoughtfully. She happened to know that Sherm was
      planning to study Cicero. How mad Mamie would be if she started Cæsar all
      alone! She had half a mind to let her go ahead. Mamie had spent the entire
      morning recess telling her how the boys bored her hanging round. Yes, it
      would do Mamie good to have to recite alone. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_279"></a>279</span>Chicken Little shut her lips firmly for a
      second. When she opened them, she replied that she understood Cæsar was a
      very interesting study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamie bridled and said condescendingly: &#8220;It&#8217;s a pity you haven&#8217;t
      had Latin so you could come into the class, too.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I see enough of Sherm at home!&#8221; returned Chicken Little
      maliciously. Mamie had the faculty of always rubbing her up the wrong way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamie gave her shoulders a fling. &#8220;Of course, I always forget you
      are just a little girl, Jane. You&#8217;re so big and&#8212;&#8221; Mamie
      didn&#8217;t finish her sentence. She merely glanced expressively at Jane&#8217;s
      long legs. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go in and talk to Mr. Clay. He must
      be sick of having all those kids hanging round him.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamie sailed off in state, leaving Jane feeling as if she had run her hand
      into a patch of nettles. She was standing there in the sunshine looking
      after Mamie resentfully when Grant Stowe came along.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded toward the schoolhouse door through which Mamie had vanished.
      &#8220;What&#8217;s Miss Flirtie been saying to make you so ruffled? She&#8217;s
      begun to sit up nights now fixing her cap for the teacher. Bet you a
      cookie he&#8217;s too slick for her.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little laughed, but retorted: &#8220;Humph, how many times have
      you sat on her front porch this summer?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_280"></a>280</span>Grant
      reddened. &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re neighbors, and a fellow has to kill time
      summer evenings. Father and mother always go to bed with the chickens and
      it&#8217;s no fun listening to the frogs all by yourself. Suppose your
      folks wouldn&#8217;t let anybody come to see you&#8211;I hear they&#8217;re
      all-fired particular.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane did not have an opportunity to answer. One of the little girls came
      begging her to play Blackman with a group of the younger children. Grant
      suggested that she choose up for one side, and he would for the other. She
      had just begun to choose when Mr. Clay appeared at her elbow. &#8220;May I
      play on your side, Jane?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Teacher&#8217;s&#8221; entrance into the game acted like magic. The
      few big boys who had come on this first day, edged near enough to be seen
      and were speedily brought into the sport. Mamie, venturing languidly to
      the door to see what had become of Mr. Clay, suddenly decided she was not
      too big to play &#8220;just this once.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Teacher and Jane were both swift runners and Grant had hard work to make a
      showing. Mamie sweetly let herself be caught by teacher the first rush, to
      Grant&#8217;s openly expressed disgust. The big boys warmed into envious
      rivalry with Mr. Clay right from the start, but he soon convinced them
      that they would have to work, if they worsted him at any of their games or
      exercises.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_281"></a>281</span>Chicken
      Little found team work with him very delightful and could scarcely believe
      the noon hour was over, when he pulled out his watch and announced that he
      must call school. She turned a radiant face up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s such fun to have you play&#8211;I wish you would
      often.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, it&#8217;s fine exercise, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamie began her Cæsar the next day, requiring much help from &#8220;Teacher.&#8221;
      She also came to school in her best dress. Mamie had faith in first
      impressions. Chicken Little had been tempted the night before to betray
      Mamie&#8217;s schemes to Sherm, but she stopped with the words on the tip
      of her tongue. She couldn&#8217;t exactly have explained the scruple that
      would not let her &#8220;give Mamie away,&#8221; as she phrased it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Is the teacher any good?&#8221; Sherm had asked, meeting her at the
      ford on her way home, and taking lunch basket and books with an air of
      possession, which was the one trick of Sherm&#8217;s that annoyed Chicken
      Little. He never asked leave or offered to relieve her of burdens; he
      merely reached over and took them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She minded this more than usual to-day; Mr. Clay&#8217;s manner had been
      so delightful. She couldn&#8217;t even thank Sherm. They trudged along in
      silence for a few minutes. Finally, Sherm asked dryly: <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_282"></a>282</span>&#8220;Left your
      tongue at school, Miss Morton?&#8211;you&#8217;re not very sociable.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little responded by making a face at him, which brought an ominous
      sparkle into the boy&#8217;s eyes. Things hadn&#8217;t gone very well with
      him that day and he had waited for Jane for a little companioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well,&#8221; he demanded gruffly, &#8220;what&#8217;s the matter?
      Did Mr. Clay stand you in a corner the first day or did the handsome Grant
      neglect you for Mamie?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The last thrust put fire in Chicken Little&#8217;s eye. She turned and
      looked at him squarely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherm, if I slapped you some day would you be surprised?&#8221; she
      demanded unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm flashed a sidelong glance at her. &#8220;Not as surprised as you&#8217;ll
      be, if you ever try it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little considered this remark. Just what did he mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm&#8217;s face was flushed a trifle angrily. He looked as if he might
      mean most anything. She replied demurely with a provoking shrug of her
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I didn&#8217;t say I should&#8211;but I wanted to dreadfully a
      minute ago.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall lad beside her seemed genuinely surprised at this statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I suppose you know what you are talking about, Chicken Little, but
      I&#8217;m blamed if I do.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_283"></a>283</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s
      the way you take my books and&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes?&#8221; Sherm was still more surprised. Then an idea popping
      into his mind, &#8220;Oh, I presume you&#8217;d like to have me take off
      my hat and make you a profound reverence as your favorite heroes do in
      novels. What in thunder you girls find to like in those trashy novels is
      more than I can see!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little bristled. &#8220;Hm-n, Walter Scott and Washington Irving,
      trashy! Shows how much you know, if you have graduated from High School,
      Sherman Dart! Besides, I didn&#8217;t mean any such thing. Only, you sort
      of take my things without asking&#8211;as if&#8211;as if&#8212;&#8221; She
      was getting into rather deeper water than she had anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, as if what?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t suppose you mean it that way&#8211;but you act as
      if I was only a silly little girl&#8211;and didn&#8217;t count!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was decidedly red in the face by the time she finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm didn&#8217;t say anything for a moment, but he continued to look at
      her. He looked at her as if he had found something about her he hadn&#8217;t
      noticed before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Who put that idea into your head?&#8211;Mamie?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Grant Stowe?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_284"></a>284</span>&#8220;Nobody,
      thank you, I guess I have a mind of my own.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;New teacher start in by giving you a lecture on deportment?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little stamped her foot. &#8220;You&#8217;re perfectful hateful&#8211;and
      I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t walk another step with you!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were near the gate leading from the lane into the orchard and she
      suited the action to the word, by darting through it and running off under
      the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm looked after her a moment, undecided whether to stand on his dignity
      or to pursue. He had considered Jane a little girl&#8211;most of the time.
      Some way she was alluringly different to-day. He suddenly resolved that he
      would not be flouted in any such fashion. It took him about two minutes to
      catch up with Chicken Little and slip his arm through hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, you don&#8217;t, Miss. You are going to sit down here under
      this tree and tell me exactly what&#8217;s the matter!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little struggled rebelliously, but Sherm held her firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I can&#8217;t&#8211;Mother told me to come straight home from
      school; she wanted me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Fibber! Your mother and Marian went over to Benton&#8217;s this
      afternoon. You needn&#8217;t try to <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_285"></a>285</span>dodge&#8211;you and I are going to have this
      out right now. So you might as well be obliging and sit down comfortably.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t anything to make such a fuss about.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Then why are you making such a row?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little flung herself down upon the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm stretched his muscular length on the sward in front of her and began
      to chew a grass stem in a leisurely fashion while he watched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little pulled a handful of long grasses and commenced plaiting
      them. Her hair was windblown and her face rose-flushed from her run. She
      declined to look at Sherm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little&#8211;O Chicken Little, are you very mad? Chicken
      Little?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little kept her brown eyes fixed upon the pliant stems.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little,&#8221; Sherm murmured softly, &#8220;you have the
      prettiest eyes of any girl I know.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little caught the touch of malice in his tone and shot an
      indignant glance at him from the aforesaid eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm laughed delightedly. &#8220;Chicken Little, you don&#8217;t need to
      tell me what&#8217;s the matter with you&#8211;I know.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little shot another indignant glance. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t
      anything the matter except what I <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_286"></a>286</span>told you&#8211;of course, it wasn&#8217;t
      anything really&#8211;only&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, there is, Chicken Little, that was only a symptom.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Stop your fooling.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want me to tell you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Bet you do&#8211;honest, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least curiosity&#8211;so you can just stop
      teasing.&#8221; Jane was positively dignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to tell you, whether you want to hear it or
      not. You&#8217;re growing up, Chicken Little, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s
      the matter with our little feelings. But don&#8217;t forget you promised
      to give me part of Ernest&#8217;s place this winter. It was a bargain,
      wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Sherm reached over and took possession of her busy
      fingers. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it? Chicken Little Jane, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane looked at this new and astonishing Sherm and nodded shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm gathered up her books with a laugh. &#8220;Come on, your mother
      wants you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;She does not&#8211;and I&#8217;m going to sit here till I make a
      grass basket for Jilly.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      September and October slipped away quietly, their warm, hazy days gay with
      turning leaves and spicily fragrant with the drying vegetation and
      ripening <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_287"></a>287</span>fruits.
      Chicken Little found school under Mr. Clay unwontedly interesting. He
      departed from the regulation mixture of three parts study and one part
      recitation and tried to lead his pupils&#8217; thoughts out into the world
      a little. Indeed, some of his innovations were regarded with suspicion by
      certain fathers and mothers in the district. When he advised his advanced
      history class to read historical novels and Shakespeare in connection with
      their work, there was much shaking of heads. But when he took advantage of
      the coming election to waken an interest in politics, the district board
      waited on him. If the visit of the school board silenced Mr. Clay, it did
      not discourage his charges, and partisanship ran high. The favorite method
      of boosting one&#8217;s candidates being to write their names on the
      blackboard at recesses and noons, and then stand guard to prevent the
      opposing faction from erasing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fun grew furious. The Mortons were staunch Republicans, and Chicken
      Little strove valiantly to write &#8220;Garfield and Arthur&#8221; earlier
      and oftener than the Democrats, led by Grant Stowe and Mamie Price, could
      replace them with &#8220;Hancock and English.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant was the biggest and strongest and bossiest lad in school. His
      favorite method of settling the enemy was to pick them up bodily and set
      them outside the schoolhouse door while he rubbed out their <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_288"></a>288</span>ticket. Or better
      still, to hold the door while Mamie or some other democrat turned the
      entire front board into a waving sea of &#8220;Hancocks and Englishes.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Republicans were in the lead as to numbers, but they were mostly the
      younger children. But few of the older boys could be spared from the farm
      work to enter school so early in the fall. So Chicken Little captained her
      side, aided by quiet suggestions from Mr. Clay who did not wish to take
      sides openly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many were the ruses employed to capture the blackboards. Jane stayed one
      evening after school to have things ready for the morrow, but, alas, Grant
      Stowe was in the habit of waiting to walk a piece home with her. He waited
      down the road till he grew suspicious, and, coming back, caught her in the
      act.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took swift revenge, none too generously, by forcing her to erase every
      line, then rubbed it in by guiding her hand to make her write the names of
      the opposition candidates. Despite all Chicken Little&#8217;s struggles,
      he persisted until the hated names were finished in writing that decidedly
      resembled crow tracks, but could be read by anyone having sufficient
      patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was furious but helpless. Mr. Clay had gone home early in
      order to drive into town <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_289"></a>289</span>that
      evening. Grant treated her anger as a good joke. She finally wrenched her
      hand loose and gave him a resounding smack across the cheek, that made her
      tormentor&#8217;s face tingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Grant&#8217;s turn to be vexed now. He caught her arm and twisted
      it till she winced. &#8220;Say you&#8217;re sorry!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I won&#8217;t!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant turned the supple wrist a twist farther. &#8220;Now, will you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No sir, not if you twist till you break it&#8211;I won&#8217;t! I&#8217;m
      not going to be bullied!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant began to be afraid she meant what she said. But his pride would not
      let him give in to a girl. &#8220;All right, little stubborn, I&#8217;ll
      kiss you till you do.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Grant loosened his hold on her wrist, Jane jerked away and fled toward
      the door in a panic. She was more than half afraid of Grant in this humor&#8211;and
      then her promise to Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, dear, I knew better than to do that, but he made me so mad!&#8221;
      she mourned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant was close upon her. She fairly hurled herself out the door and most
      unexpectedly bumped into Sherm, who caught her in time to save her
      catapulting down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Save the pieces, Chicken Little, what&#8217;s your hurry?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_290"></a>290</span>&#8220;O
      Sherm,&#8211;oh, I&#8217;m so glad you came&#8211;I&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she could finish Grant reached the door, stopping short on seeing
      Sherm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane clutched Sherm&#8217;s arm tight. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him, please
      don&#8217;t let him!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her words were not entirely clear, but Sherm promptly shoved her behind
      him and confronted Grant angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Big business you&#8217;re in, frightening girls&#8211;you bully!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm had taken a dislike to Grant that evening at Mamie&#8217;s and
      exulted in this opportunity to pick a quarrel. Grant was equally ready. He
      scorned explanations and replied by pulling off his coat. Sherm swiftly
      peeled his also. Chicken Little was alarmed by these warlike preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t, boys, don&#8217;t! I guess it was part my fault,
      Sherm. Grant didn&#8217;t mean any harm. We were scrapping over the
      election and&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t care whether it was your fault or not, Jane. If Grant
      doesn&#8217;t know enough to be a gentleman, it&#8217;s time he learned.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm sprang forward and the boys clinched. They were pretty evenly
      matched. Grant outweighed Sherm, but the latter was quicker and had had
      some training in wrestling. This was the popular method of settling
      quarrels, boxing not having come into vogue. Inside of three minutes both
      were <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_291"></a>291</span>down,
      rolling over the ground an indiscriminate, writhing heap of arms and legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was utterly dismayed. She didn&#8217;t want either of the
      boys hurt, but they heeded her remonstrances no more than if she had been
      a mosquito. She even tried pulling at the one who came uppermost, but they
      both pantingly warned her off. Chicken Little set her jaw firmly. She flew
      into the schoolhouse to the water bench, and seizing the water bucket,
      flew out. Pausing long enough to take good aim, she dashed its contents
      over the boys&#8217; heads with all her might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant being underneath at the moment, with lips parted from his exertions,
      received the full force of the water in his mouth and nose, and nearly
      strangled from the dose. Sherm had to let him up and apply first aid to
      help him recover his breath&#8211;the lad was purple. When he began to
      breathe readily once more, both boys got to their feet, glaring
      reproachfully at Chicken Little. Each was restrained by the presence of
      the other from expressing forcibly his opinion of the young lady. The
      heroine was in wrong with both the villain and the hero. However, the
      heroine did not care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You boys ought to be ashamed of yourselves, both of you&#8211;fighting
      like a pair of kids. I wish you could see yourselves! You look exactly
      like drowned rats!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_292"></a>292</span>The lads
      could not not see themselves, but they could see each other, and the
      exhibit was convincing. Sherm&#8217;s mouth puckered into its crooked
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s the way you feel about it, Chicken Little, it&#8217;s
      all right with me. So long, Grant.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm picked up his coat and cap and set off, leaving Jane to follow or
      linger as she saw fit. She turned to Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to get you into trouble, Grant.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it, and, truly&#8211;I didn&#8217;t intend to
      frighten you, Chicken Little. I guess you aren&#8217;t like most of the
      girls on the Creek&#8211;I didn&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;d take it that
      way. Good-bye, Sherm,&#8221; he called. Grant also picked up his
      belongings and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little rescued the water pail and carried it into the schoolhouse.
      She secured her hat and lunch basket, and was starting for the door when a
      wonderful idea buzzed in her brain. Slipping to the window she glanced
      out. Grant was striding rapidly off up the road. She ran to the board and
      hastily erased that hateful &#8220;Hancock and English&#8221; and as
      hastily wrote the names of the other presidential candidates in letters a
      foot high across the front board, underlining them heavily and putting
      hands pointing toward them on each of the side boards. This done, she
      locked the schoolhouse <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_293"></a>293</span>door,
      as she had promised Mr. Clay, and, taking the key over to a neighbor&#8217;s
      a few rods away, joyously departed homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm was not in sight when she started. A little farther down the hill
      she saw him waiting beside a haystack. He had evidently been watching to
      make sure she did not get into further trouble. He walked briskly on as
      soon as he caught sight of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Dart looked a trifle sulky at supper that evening. Chicken
      Little tried to attract his attention in various ways without success.
      Sherm was resolved to ignore her. Finally, she addressed him directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Won&#8217;t you please pass the water, Sherm?&#8221; she asked with
      exaggerated meekness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm grinned in spite of himself. The other members of the family looked
      at Jane inquiringly. Jane, having received the water, ate her supper in
      profound silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came on her unexpectedly down by the spring a little later. It was
      growing dark and he did not see her until he was almost beside her. He
      hesitated a moment, then joined her. She glanced up demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He regarded her an instant in complete silence. Chicken Little tossed her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_294"></a>294</span>Sherm came a
      step closer and Jane prepared to fly if necessary, but Sherm contented
      himself with staring at her till he made her drop her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You mischievous witch, I&#8217;d like to shake you hard!&#8221;

    <h2>
      THE PRAIRIE FIRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The prairies were brown&#8211;a dead, crisp brown, as if they had been
      baked by hot suns through long, rainless days and nipped by a whole winter
      of killing frosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why the grass is so dry by the middle of
      November,&#8221; said Dr. Morton. &#8220;Of course the summer was pretty
      dry, but then we had rains in September.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Father,&#8221; Frank replied, &#8220;but there has been less
      rainfall for the past two years than Kansas has known for a decade. I
      imagine the ground is baked underneath on the prairies, and the rains only
      helped for a time.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, whatever caused it, we shall have to feed earlier than usual.
      I am afraid we may have some <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_296"></a>296</span>bad
      fires, too, if we don&#8217;t have rain or a snowfall soon.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There was a fire over on Elm Creek night before last,&#8221; spoke
      up Sherm. &#8220;Grant Stowe&#8217;s cousin was telling us about it at
      school.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I saw smoke off to the north yesterday,&#8221; said Chicken Little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I hope we sha&#8217;n&#8217;t have any bad fires this fall!&#8221;
      exclaimed Mrs. Morton. &#8220;I do think a big prairie fire is one of the
      most terrifying sights, especially at night. I couldn&#8217;t sleep that
      first fall for dreading them. I used to get up in the middle of the night
      and look out the windows to see if that awful glare was anywhere on the
      horizon.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t go borrowing trouble, Mother. There hasn&#8217;t been a
      bad fire on Big John for years. The country is so thickly settled a fire
      doesn&#8217;t have the sweep it used to.&#8221; Dr. Morton tried to
      reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They must be wonderful things to see. I hope there won&#8217;t be
      any bad ones, but if one shows up anywhere within ten miles, I propose to
      be on hand,&#8221; Sherm said eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You won&#8217;t be so keen after you have fought one or two, Sherm.&#8221;
      Frank smiled with the wisdom of the initiated. &#8220;Say, Father, I think
      Jim and I had better fire round those stacks on the north eighty. <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_297"></a>297</span>It would be hard to
      save them if a fire got started on the divide.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I don&#8217;t know but you&#8217;d best do it this afternoon.
      Burn a pretty wide strip. And we ought to run a guard on the west from
      that field of winter wheat to the county road. If a fire ever got in
      there, it might come down on the house.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little spoke up. &#8220;May I go, too, Frank? I love to watch you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You will be in school, but you can come home that way if we are
      still at work. You can easily see the smoke. We won&#8217;t try it if the
      wind rises, and I believe it is going to.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little, if you see the smoke you may tell Mr. Clay I won&#8217;t
      come for my recitation this afternoon. I am going to find out how this
      back-firing business is done.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm had begun his studies some two weeks previous and was making rapid
      progress, studying evenings, and going to the school a half hour before
      closing time to recite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little found this arrangement extremely pleasant, because Sherm
      was always there to walk home with her. They took all sorts of detours and
      by-paths through the woods, instead of coming along the road to the ford.
      They discovered unexpected stores of walnuts and acorns and wild rose
      hips, and scarlet bitter-sweet just <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_298"></a>298</span>opening its gorgeous berries after the first
      hard frosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane helped Sherm press autumn leaves and pack a huge box of nuts to send
      home. His mother wrote back that his father hadn&#8217;t showed as much
      interest in anything for weeks, as he did in the nuts. They seemed to
      carry him back to his own boyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dart seldom left his bed now, and Sherm&#8217;s mother told but little
      of his condition. Sherm understood her silence only too well. Chicken
      Little noticed that he always worked hard and late the days he heard from
      home. She began to watch for the letters herself, and to mount guard over
      the boy when he looked specially downcast, teasing him into going for a
      gallop or wheedling him into making taffy or playing a game of checkers.
      She got so she recognized Sherm&#8217;s blue devils as far off as she
      could see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm did not notice this for some time or suspect she was looking after
      him, but one day he remarked carelessly when she thought she had been
      specially clever:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little, don&#8217;t make a mollycoddle of me. A man has to
      learn to take what comes his way without squealing.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Sherm, but if you get thorns in your hand, it&#8217;s better
      to try to pull them out than to go on pushing them in deeper, isn&#8217;t
      it? I know when I was <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_299"></a>299</span>a
      kid, it always helped a lot to have Mother kiss it better.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;How&#8217;d you get so wise, Chicken Little?&#8221; The lad smiled
      his wry smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t make fun of me, please, Sherm.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Make fun of you? Lady Jane, I&#8217;ve been taking off my hat to
      you for a week. How in the dickens you girls find out exactly what&#8217;s
      going on inside a chap beats my time. It&#8217;s mighty good of you to put
      up with my glooming and try to cheer me along. Maybe I don&#8217;t look
      grateful, but I am.&#8221; Sherm was eager to make this acknowledgment,
      but found it more trying than he had anticipated. He revenged himself by
      starting in to tease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Say, I wish you&#8217;d try your hand at this splinter&#8211;I can&#8217;t
      budge the critter.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane flew for a needle, unsuspecting. The splinter didn&#8217;t look
      serious, but she painstakingly dug it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Is that all right?&#8221; she demanded, looking up to encounter a
      wicked glint in Sherm&#8217;s gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Hm-n, aren&#8217;t you going to put any medicine on it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Medicine?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, you know you said it helped.&#8221; Sherm was grinning
      impishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherman Dart, I think you&#8217;re too mean for <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_300"></a>300</span>words!&#8221; She
      was about to turn away affronted when she had an inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mother,&#8221; she called, &#8220;O Mother!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton had been placidly sewing in the sitting room while the young
      people were studying their lessons by the dining-room table. She came to
      the door, inquiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mother, Sherm&#8217;s had a splinter in his finger and he wants you
      to kiss it better.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm started to protest, but Mrs. Morton did not stop to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Jane, I think that kind of a joke is very ill-timed, making your
      poor mother get up and come to you for nothing. You must remember I am not
      as young as I once was.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton departed with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Now will you be good?&#8221; chuckled Sherm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I guess I&#8217;m square,&#8221; Chicken Little retorted, going
      back to her lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton had said truly that she was not so young as formerly. She had
      not been well all fall. Dr. Morton had persuaded her to see another
      physician, who, having assured her that she was merely run down, had
      prescribed the usual tonic. He had told Dr. Morton, however, that her
      heart action was weak and warned him to guard her against shocks of any
      kind and to have her rest as much as possible. This had agreed with the
      doctor&#8217;s own diagnosis of <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_301"></a>301</span>her condition, and the family had been trying
      to save her from all exertion. So Chicken Little was a tiny bit
      conscience-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      High winds and more pressing farm duties had interfered with running the
      fire guards. It was not until the week before Thanksgiving that the men
      got at it, then they succeeded only in protecting the stacks. They had
      intended to finish the job the following morning, but one of the
      neighbors, passing through the lane, stopped to tell Dr. Morton of a sale
      of yearlings to be held the next afternoon in the neighboring county.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It must be part of the Elliott herd. They&#8217;re three-quarters
      bred shorthorn; I&#8217;d like mighty well to pick up a bunch of them. We
      have plenty of feed for any ordinary winter.&#8221; Dr. Morton was talking
      the matter over with Frank after supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Suppose we ride over, Father, it&#8217;s only about twenty miles.
      We can start early&#8211;we don&#8217;t need to buy unless they are
      actually a bargain.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were off at six the following morning, planning to return the same
      day. Dr. Morton, however, warned his wife not to be anxious if she did not
      see them before the next afternoon. If they bought the steers, they would
      not try to drive them home the same day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was bright and pleasant, but the wind rose toward mid-day and
      was blowing a young <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_302"></a>302</span>gale
      by the time Chicken Little returned from school at half-past four. Mrs.
      Morton began worrying lest the doctor and Frank had not wrapped up
      sufficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, it isn&#8217;t cold yet, Mrs. Morton. In fact, it is
      astonishingly warm for November. And there&#8217;s the queerest, yellowish
      haze I have ever seen.&#8221; Sherm said this to reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Probably dust,&#8221; replied Mrs. Morton carelessly, relieved from
      her anxiety about her family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little hurried through her supper and went over to see Marian.
      Presently Marian threw a shawl over her head and they both climbed the
      hill back of the house. The wind was still blowing fiercely. Sherm saw
      them on the ridge and followed to see what was tempting them to a stroll
      on such a night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian answered. &#8220;Why, Jane thinks all this yellow haze comes from a
      prairie fire. We&#8217;ve been trying to see if we could see any trace of
      it. It seems to me I do smell smoke&#8211;there&#8217;s a kind of pungent
      tang to the air, too.&#8221; Marian sniffed uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Like burning grass or leaves?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian&#8217;s face paled. &#8220;Sherm, that&#8217;s exactly what it is!
      What can we do? And the menfolks all away except Jim Bart, and he&#8217;s
      gone to Benton&#8217;s on an <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_303"></a>303</span>errand.
      He&#8217;ll be back in a few minutes though.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Marian,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;if it&#8217;s a
      prairie fire it&#8217;s miles and miles off. It must be on the other side
      of Little John. It can never cross the creek&#8211;besides, the wind is
      blowing the wrong way for it to sweep down on us.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s so&#8211;but the wind might change any minute, and in
      a gale like this I&#8217;m not so sure it might not jump Little John. I do
      wish Frank had finished that back-firing.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I suppose it wouldn&#8217;t be possible to do it until the wind
      lulls, but Mrs. Morton, I&#8217;ll sit up and watch to-night&#8211;at
      least until the wind goes down. It often falls about midnight,&#8221; said
      Sherm, looking troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It looks to me as if we were in for a three-days&#8217; blow,&#8221;
      Marian replied despondently. &#8220;But I&#8217;d be much obliged if you
      would, Sherm, I don&#8217;t quite like to ask Jim Bart to, for he&#8217;s
      had such a hard day. Do you think you can keep awake? And, Chicken Little,
      don&#8217;t let on to Mother&#8211;we mustn&#8217;t worry her.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherm,&#8221; said Jane, after they went into the house, &#8220;I&#8217;m
      going to stay up, too; I&#8217;ll slip down again after Mother goes to
      bed. It&#8217;s a lot easier for two people to keep awake than one.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, Chicken Little, I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;d better. Your
      mother wouldn&#8217;t like it. And we&#8217;d be dead sure to laugh or
      talk loud enough for her to hear <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_304"></a>304</span>us. I hope the wind will go down early. If it
      doesn&#8217;t and I find I can&#8217;t stay awake, I&#8217;ll call you and
      let you watch while I doze on the couch here.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane stayed up as late as her mother would let her, and Sherm made the
      excuse of having special studying to do, to sit up later. After Mrs.
      Morton had retired he made frequent excursions to the hill top. A lurid
      glare lit up the horizon to the northwest. He could still catch the tang
      of smoke and whiffs of burning grass, but these were not so pungent as
      earlier in the evening. The fire seemed farther away. By eleven, the glare
      was decidedly fainter and the wind had subsided noticeably. At twelve, he
      concluded it was safe to go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little waking about two, stole down stairs and finding everything
      dark, made the rounds of the windows, but the distant fire showed only a
      faint glow in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they arose the next morning there was no trace of the fire to be
      seen. Sherm hailed some men passing, for news. They reported that it had
      swept the north side of Elm Creek and said it had burned up a lot of hay.
      There was a rumor that two of the upland farmers had lost everything they
      had and that a man and team had been caught in it. But they hadn&#8217;t
      been able to get any details.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Though it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising,&#8221; one of the <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_305"></a>305</span>strangers added,
      &#8220;that fire was traveling faster than any horse could run.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little had come out and was standing beside Sherm. Her eyes grew
      big. &#8220;Do they really think somebody got burned?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the men nudged the man who had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, Sis, it was just a rumor&#8211;I don&#8217;t &#8217;low it was
      true. When folks can&#8217;t give you any name or place&#8211;it most
      generally ain&#8217;t so.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The men drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Saturday. Jim Bart had gone down to town for the weekly supplies
      and Sherm was busy with odd jobs. He asked Jane to go up to the hill top
      occasionally to make sure there were no fresh signs of the fire, though
      Jim Bart had assured him the danger was over. Sherm noticed that the wind
      had changed. It was blowing freshly from the very direction where they had
      seen the fire the preceding night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little obediently made trips once an hour until noon; she could
      detect nothing to occasion alarm. After dinner her mother set her to
      making doughnuts and she forgot all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton was not so well to-day and Jane persuaded her to go to bed.
      Drawing the blinds to, she put a hot iron to her mother&#8217;s feet and
      left her to sleep. The clock striking four attracted Jane&#8217;s
      attention as she came back into the sitting room, the <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_306"></a>306</span>last doughnut was
      draining in the collender while Annie mopped the kitchen floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood irresolute for an instant, undecided whether to read or to fetch
      some walnuts from the smokehouse for Sunday. Dr. Morton always liked to
      have a basket of walnuts handy on Sunday afternoons. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll
      get the nuts, and perhaps I&#8217;d better run up the hill to be sure that
      old fire hasn&#8217;t had a change of heart. Father says often some little
      side fire smolders and burns after the main fire is all out. Though I
      guess one would have showed up long before this if there&#8217;d been any
      this time.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She argued with herself for two or three minutes, finally deciding that it
      wasn&#8217;t much trouble to go take a look, even if it were foolish. Just
      outside the door she met Sherm and he walked up to the crest with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half way up the slope Chicken Little suddenly stopped, sniffing
      suspiciously. &#8220;Sherm, I believe I smell smoke again.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm stopped also to draw in a long breath. He did not wait to announce
      his observations, but broke into a run for the top of the hill. Chicken
      Little followed him a length in the rear. Sherm took one look and gave
      vent to a surprised whistle. Chicken Little stared, fascinated, at a tiny
      line of fire burning merrily on a hillside not a mile distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_307"></a>307</span>&#8220;Jumping
      Jehosophat!&#8221; exclaimed Sherm, &#8220;how did it ever creep up on us
      this way?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane was thinking rapidly. She scarcely noticed what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherm, Frank left the water barrels and the mops and everything on
      the wagon, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes&#8211;what&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Are the barrels filled?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yep, do you think&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherm, run hitch the bay team to the wagon quick. I&#8217;ll get
      Marian and warn Annie not to tell Mother&#8211;she&#8217;s asleep still.
      Hurry, Sherm, every minute&#8217;s precious!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm&#8217;s &#8220;All right&#8221; drifted from him on the run. He was
      already on his way to the stable. He realized that Jane knew more about
      fire fighting than he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane hurried to the cottage. Marian listened to her news, white to the
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Annie can take Jilly. Perhaps I&#8217;d better ride over after Mr.
      Benton.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Marian,&#8221; protested Chicken Little, &#8220;there isn&#8217;t
      time. And if Mr. Benton&#8217;s home, he has probably seen it, too, and is
      trying to protect his own place. No, we&#8217;ve got to work fast. Unless
      we can run a fire guard before the fire reaches that tall grass on the
      division line, the whole place is a goner! It isn&#8217;t coming very fast
      yet. Here, I&#8217;ll run with Jilly <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_308"></a>308</span>over to the house and you put on a pair of
      Frank&#8217;s trousers&#8211;your skirts might catch. I&#8217;ll get that
      old pair of Ernest&#8217;s. Hurry, Marian, hurry!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little gathered up Jilly and started on the run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Marian and Jane reached the stable yard just as Sherm drove the heavy
      farm wagon clattering out of the gate. They hurriedly climbed in and Sherm
      lashed the horses into a gallop. As they passed the cottage, Marian
      exclaimed: &#8220;Did you get matches either of you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm slowed up the team and examined his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;A handful.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Stop a moment&#8211;I&#8217;ll run fetch a box. It takes a lot.&#8221;
      Chicken Little was over the wheel before the words were fairly out of her
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was back in a jiffy with the matches, which she proceeded to divide
      among them, while the horses leaped forward again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Stop on the backbone where the Santa Fe trail strikes the road.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Precisely four minutes later Sherm pulled up the panting team. Chicken
      Little promptly took command. She had been out many times with her father
      and brothers and knew exactly what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Wet your mop&#8211;take a bucket of water and fire <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_309"></a>309</span>right along the
      trail, Marian,&#8211;that buffalo grass burns slow. Call if it starts to
      get away from you. I&#8217;ll begin there by the hedge. Drive about fifty
      yards farther on, Sherm,&#8211;the horses will stand. Fill all the buckets
      and wet the extra mops. We&#8217;re liable to want them in a rush.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;All right, Jane, save your breath&#8211;you&#8217;ll need it.
      Careful there, Mrs. Morton, beat out the flames along the trail as you go.
      Never mind how fast it whoops the other way. Cæsar&#8217;s ghost! that
      fire is getting close!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The waving, irregular lines of flame on the hillside were coming steadily
      on, now leaping up several feet high as the breeze freshened, now creeping
      close to the ground when the gusts died away. The wind was fitful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian and Sherm both had their trail of fire flickering into a blaze
      before Chicken Little got hers kindled. Her hands shook so she could
      hardly hold the match. The first flickered and went out, a second, then a
      third, blackened, before she could coax the stubbly grass to burn. She
      caught up a bunch of weeds, set it blazing in her hand and dragged it
      swiftly along the ground. Tiny swirls of yellow flame wavered in her wake,
      crackled feebly for an instant in the shorter herbage, then, reaching out
      tongues into the longer blue stem beyond, leaped forward like a frolicsome
      animal. Sherm&#8217;s and <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_310"></a>310</span>Marian&#8217;s
      lines of fire were eating their way merrily toward hers on each side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy to beat out the flame in the Buffalo grass, which formed their
      safety line toward the house, and the three soon had several hundred feet
      of fire running to meet those menacing flames on the neighboring hillside.
      For a while it seemed almost pretty play save for that haunting dread of
      disaster. But the dripping mops were heavy for girls&#8217; wrists and
      arms, the constant stooping and rising and the lifting of the heavy
      buckets pulled painfully on aching muscles. They must backfire for a third
      of a mile before they dared hope the place was safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      A field of winter wheat adjoining the wagon road where they had started,
      and extending down to the bank of Big John, was the best of protection to
      the lower half of the farm. West from this, there was neither track nor
      field to break the tindery sweeps of prairie grass, until the strip of
      breaking on the north boundary of the pasture was reached. The old Santa
      Fe trail along which they were firing, fortunately extended to within some
      two hundred yards of the breaking, and was their safeguard against the
      ever-present danger of letting the fire get away from them to the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Older heads would have selected that hundred yards of high grass as a
      starting place, while they <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_311"></a>311</span>were
      fresh and best able to cope with its perils. Chicken Little was leaving it
      to the last. Swiftly as the three worked, the head fire was rapidly
      gaining on them. Again and again, one of them glanced toward the house in
      the hope that Jim Bart might have returned, or some neighbor have seen
      their danger and be on the way to help. Not a human being was in sight in
      any direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian straightened up with a groan and glanced despairingly at the head
      fire. Sherm&#8217;s gaze followed hers anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to do better than this, girls. Here, Chicken
      Little, make a torch of some of those resinous weeds&#8211;those long
      crackly ones&#8211;and fire just as fast as you can. I&#8217;ll follow
      with the mop and yell if I can&#8217;t manage it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan worked well for a time&#8211;their haven of hope, the brown strip
      of breaking, seemed to move steadily nearer. But Chicken Little and Marian
      were fast becoming exhausted. The main fire was now so close that its
      smoke was beginning to drift in their faces. Prairie chickens and quail,
      startled and confused by the double line of flame, whirred above their
      heads, uncertain how to seek safety. A terrified jack rabbit leaped up
      almost at Sherm&#8217;s feet. Rabbits, ground squirrels, one lone skunk,
      and even an occasional coyote, darted past them. Back at the road where
      they had begun, the head fire was already <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_312"></a>312</span>meeting their line of back fire and dying down
      in sullen smoke. Still, that hundred yards of blue stem was untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      They paused a moment at its edge in hurried consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s souse all the mops&#8211;dripping wet&#8211;and trail
      across first,&#8221; suggested Chicken Little in short, labored gasps. She
      had been running for several minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, and then fire back. Christ!&#8211;we must hurry!&#8221; Sherm,
      too, was breathless. &#8220;Can you stick it out a few minutes longer,
      Marian?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian Morton&#8217;s face was drawn and colorless. She nodded and rested
      a moment, leaning on her mop.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next sixty-five yards the blows of the wet mops rained down with
      the precision of clock work. Twice the flames started in quick eddies back
      of their line, but, panting, the girls almost sobbing, they beat them
      back. The smoke was growing stifling. The wind, freshening, blew it from
      both fires full in their faces. They could see only a few feet ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Light another torch and run, Chicken Little&#8211;there&#8217;s no
      time to lose&#8211;we must chance it!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little obeyed silently. Half way to the breaking she stumbled and
      fell. Her torch of twisted grass flew from her hand, scattering the
      burning fragments about her. Before she could get <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_313"></a>313</span>to her feet, the
      grass was ablaze all around. Quick-witted Sherm threw her a mop, then beat
      his way toward her. Marian, summoning her last remaining strength, ran to
      help, but sank to the ground in a faint before she could reach Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm and Chicken Little, beating, stamping madly, did not see her fall.
      The flames fairly licked up the long grass. They beat them out around Jane
      only to see them spread in an ever-increasing circle. Chicken Little&#8217;s
      legs gave way under her and she sank helplessly down, watching the rushing
      fire. Sherm struggled on with parched throat and stinging eyes, but he,
      too, was fast becoming exhausted in the unequal fight, when a strong pair
      of hands seized the mop from his straining arms and rained swift blows on
      the flaming grass. Answering blows resounded from four other stout pairs
      of hands and an irregular line of charred vegetation was soon all that was
      left to tell the tale of the danger they had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Thank God, we got here in time!&#8221; Captain Clarke ejaculated
      fervently, raising Marian&#8217;s head and dashing water in her face to
      restore her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We&#8217;re so shut in by the timber at our place, I didn&#8217;t
      dream the fire was in this part of the country till one of the hands went
      up in the pasture. We mounted and came double quick, I tell you. And we&#8217;d
      have got here quicker, if I&#8217;d known what straits <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_314"></a>314</span>you were in. You&#8217;re
      a plucky lot! Easy there, Mrs. Morton, you are all right, and the fire is
      safe to smoke out at its leisure. Here, drink a drop of this whiskey.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm had gathered up Chicken Little and carried her beyond the smoke,
      then dropped down beside her with a sigh to recover his breath. He felt
      numb and so dazed he hardly heeded what the Captain was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Pretty well done for, yourself, aren&#8217;t you, lad?&#8221; one
      of the men inquired. &#8220;You sure knew exactly what to do, if you are a
      tenderfoot.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm roused himself enough to twist the corners of his mouth into his
      wonted smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Me? I didn&#8217;t do anything&#8211;Chicken Little was the boss of
      this gang.&#8221;

      THE LOST OYSTER SUPPER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thanksgiving came and went its turkey-lined way rather lonesomely.
      Christmas preparations also lacked their usual zest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Everything seems to have caved in round where Ernest was,&#8221;
      Chicken Little confided to Marian. &#8220;You see, we always talked
      everything over and planned our Christmas together. Sherm takes Ernest&#8217;s
      place in lots of ways, but, of course, he isn&#8217;t interested in what I&#8217;m
      making for Mother, or in helping me make $5.25 go clear round the family
      and piece out for Katy and Gertie besides.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If sympathy is all you need, Jane, I can lend you a listening ear.&#8221;
      Marian crocheted another scallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;d be thankful for a few suggestions, too, I can&#8217;t
      think of anything to send Ernest. When he <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_316"></a>316</span>has to have everything regulation, and the
      government furnishes him with every single thing it wants him to have, why&#8211;it&#8217;s
      awful.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I agree with you&#8211;I&#8217;ve been racking my brains for
      Ernest, too. Mother is patiently knitting him a muffler, which I know he
      won&#8217;t be permitted to wear, but I haven&#8217;t the heart to
      discourage her&#8211;she gets so much comfort out of it. Uncle Sam should
      be more considerate of fond female relatives. He might at least tolerate a
      few tidies and hand-painted shovels or a home-made necktie.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Or a throw or a plush table cover with chenille embroidery. Mamie
      Jenkins is making one for Mr. Clay. He will be too cross for words. He
      loathes Mamie, though he tries not to show it, and plush is his special
      abomination. He says it reminds him of caterpillar&#8217;s fuzz.&#8221;
      Chicken Little&#8217;s eyes danced maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian looked at her young sister-in-law meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mamie doesn&#8217;t seem to be dear to your heart just now. Is she
      too popular or too affected or too dressy?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s just too utterly too too all around. I do have lots
      of fun with her&#8211;she can be awfully nice when she wants to be, but&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know&#8211;she swells up so, lots of times <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_317"></a>317</span>over things I&#8217;d
      be ashamed to tell&#8211;they&#8217;re so silly.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I guess Mamie&#8217;s pretty cheap, but as long as you make
      friends with her, don&#8217;t rap her behind her back. It was all right to
      tell me&#8211;I quizzed you anyhow. I wish you didn&#8217;t see so much of
      her.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, she&#8217;s the only girl at school I can go with, who is
      anywhere near my own age. The Kearns twins aren&#8217;t even clean&#8211;I
      don&#8217;t like to go near them.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think you would. Our public school system has its
      drawbacks as well as its virtues. Well, Jane, be nice to Mamie, but don&#8217;t&#8211;don&#8217;t
      be like her.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You needn&#8217;t worry; she&#8217;s going to town to school after
      Christmas, so I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t see much more of her.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton was still far from well, and she hung on Ernest&#8217;s
      letters almost pathetically. Ernest, boy fashion, was inclined to write
      long letters when he had something interesting to tell and preserve a
      stony silence when he didn&#8217;t. Life at the academy was monotonous and
      he had to work hard to keep up with his studies. Further, his father and
      Frank suspected he was having many disagreeable experiences which he kept
      from his family. These were still the days of rough hazing at the academy
      and Ernest, being a western boy, big and strong and independent, was
      likely to attract his full share of this unpleasant nagging. He revealed
      something <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_318"></a>318</span>of
      his experiences in a letter to Sherm. Sherm showed the letter to Chicken
      Little and Chicken Little, vaguely worried, told her father. Dr. Morton
      talked it over with Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There isn&#8217;t a thing you can do about it, Father. Most of it
      does the boys more good than harm anyway. I talked to a West Pointer once
      about the hazing there. He said some of it was pretty annoying and at
      times decidedly rough, but that if a fellow behaved himself and took it
      good-naturedly they soon let him alone. He said it was the best training
      he had ever known for curing a growing boy of the big head. Don&#8217;t
      worry&#8211;Ernest has sense&#8211;he&#8217;s all right.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      To Chicken Little, Ernest confided, two weeks before Christmas, that he
      was getting confoundedly tired of having the same things to eat week after
      week. &#8220;Say, Sis, if you and Mother would cook me up a lot of goodies
      for Christmas, I&#8217;d like it better than anything you could do. Send
      lots, so I can treat&#8211;a turkey and fixings.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter did more for Mrs. Morton&#8217;s health than the doctor&#8217;s
      tonic. She tied on her apron and set to making fruit cake and cookies and
      every delicious and indigestible compound she could think of that would
      stand packing and a four-days&#8217; journey. Chicken Little and Sherm
      spent their evenings making candy and picking out walnut meats to send.
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_319"></a>319</span>Dr. Morton
      made the nine-mile trip to town on the coldest day of the season to insure
      Ernest&#8217;s getting the box on the very day before Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family at the ranch had a quiet holiday week. The day after New Year&#8217;s,
      Jane was invited to come to town and stay over night to attend an amateur
      performance of Fatinitza, a light opera the young people had staged for
      the benefit of a struggling musical society. Chicken Little was excitedly
      eager to go. Mrs. Morton deliberated for some time before she gave her
      consent. Marian and Frank and Sherm all teased in her behalf, before it
      was won.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm drove her in, and Frank, having business in town the following day
      with a cattle buyer from Kansas City, volunteered to bring her home. Jane
      wore her Christmas present, a crimson cashmere with fine knife plaitings
      of crimson satin for its adorning. Frank lent her his sealskin cap and she
      felt very grand, and looked piquantly radiant, as she revolved for her
      mother&#8217;s inspection before slipping into her big coat. Sherm,
      standing waiting, inspected her, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Scrumptious, Lady Jane, you look like that red bird I&#8217;ve been
      trying to catch out in the evergreen by the gate.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton shook her head disapprovingly. &#8220;No compliments, Sherm,
      Jane is just a little girl and she must remember that pretty is as pretty
      does. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_320"></a>320</span>Don&#8217;t
      forget, dear, to thank Mrs. Webb for her hospitality when you come away.
      Are you sure your ears are clean?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, Mother, I&#8217;m not a baby!&#8221; Chicken Little protested
      indignantly. &#8220;You talk as if I were about five years old.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My dear daughter, your mother will speak to you as she sees fit.
      Have you got the high overshoes? I think, perhaps, you&#8217;d better take
      Father&#8217;s muffler. Sherm, have you both buffalo robes?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little relieved her feelings by making a little moue at Sherm. He
      winked discreetly in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why,&#8221; she said disgustedly after they were started, &#8220;won&#8217;t
      mothers ever let you grow up? I am a whole inch taller than Mother now,
      and half the time she treats me as if I didn&#8217;t have the sense of a
      chicken.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, you see you&#8217;re the only girl in the family, and you&#8217;ve
      been the littlest chicken so long your mother kind of likes to shut her
      eyes to all those extra inches you&#8217;ve been collecting. By the way,
      Miss Morton, I don&#8217;t notice that muffler your mother mentioned, and
      I think you&#8217;ll be cold enough before we get to town to wish you had
      it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose I was going to wear that clumsy thing? I
      can snuggle down under the robes if I get cold.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_321"></a>321</span>&#8220;No, I
      didn&#8217;t suppose, so I brought the red scarf Mother gave me Christmas,
      for your ears. They&#8217;d be frosted sure without anything. Did you
      think your pride would keep you warm, Chicken Little?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was inclined to resent this delicate attention; Sherm
      seemed to be putting her in the same class her mother had. But her ears
      were already beginning to tingle as they left the timber and got the full
      force of the wind on the open prairie. Sherm was swinging the bays along
      at a good pace. The cutter glided smoothly over the frozen snow. She
      submitted meekly while he awkwardly wrapped the muffler over her cap with
      his free hand. The soft wool was deliciously comfortable. She neglected,
      however, to mention this fact to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Too stubborn to own up, Lady Jane?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane stole a glance at the quizzical face turned in her direction. Then
      she evaded shamelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherm, don&#8217;t you just adore to skate?&#8221;
    </p>
    <hr style="border:none; border-bottom:1px solid silver; height: 1px; width: 80%; text-align: center; margin: 10px auto;" />
    <p>
      Chicken Little was in a pulsing state of excitement that evening as she
      listened to the pretty, lilting music and watched gorgeously clad young
      people, many of whom she recognized, moving demurely about the little
      stage. To others it was merely a very creditable amateur performance; to
      Chicken Little, it opened a whole new world of ideas and imagining. She
      had been to a theatre but twice in <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_322"></a>322</span>her whole life, once to Uncle Tom&#8217;s
      Cabin and once to a horrible presentation of Hamlet, which resulted in her
      disliking the play to the day of her death. She loved the light and color
      and harmony of it all. She delighted in it so much that she sighed because
      it would be so soon over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What are you sighing for, Jane? Don&#8217;t you like it?&#8221; her
      hostess inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little gave a little wriggle of joy. &#8220;Like it? I just love
      it&#8211;it&#8217;s like butterflies keeping house. Don&#8217;t you wish
      everything was like that&#8211;pretty and gay, with all the lovers getting
      things straightened out right?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Dear me, Jane, do you get all that out of this poor little comic
      opera? I must have you come in to all our amateur things if you love music
      so.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t love music so very much&#8211;I hate to practice. I
      shouldn&#8217;t care for their singing very much by itself, it&#8217;s
      seeing the actors and thinking how they feel&#8211;and their pretty
      clothes and&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Webb laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little, I envy you&#8211;you are going to see so many
      things that most people shut their eyes to.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane studied about this, but she hardly liked to ask what things Mrs. Webb
      meant, because that lady seemed to expect her to know, and she felt she
      would appear stupid not to. She lay awake a long time that night; the
      music seemed to be splashing <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_323"></a>323</span>over
      her in little waves of melody. Even after she had once fallen asleep, she
      awakened to find her brain still humming the insistent measures. The next
      morning she went downtown with her hostess and met Mamie Jenkins in a
      store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, Chicken Little, I didn&#8217;t know you were in town? Your
      brother didn&#8217;t say anything about your being here.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Frank? Is he in already?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I just saw him. Say, did you know a crowd of us are going out
      to his house to-night to an oyster supper?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, who&#8217;s going?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, a lot of the town boys and girls, and Grant Stowe and me. John
      Hardy asked him if a crowd of us couldn&#8217;t come out to-night and
      surprise your sister, and Frank said come along, he&#8217;d have some hot
      oysters for us. The boys have got a big bobsled from the livery stable. I
      bet we have a lovely time. Why don&#8217;t you and Sherm stay in and go
      out with us&#8211;I guess there&#8217;ll be room. Anyhow, you can always
      crowd more into a bobsled, it&#8217;s more fun when you&#8217;re packed
      in.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamie giggled expressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane was surprised to learn that Sherm had come in with Frank and she was
      also extremely doubtful whether her mother would approve of her waiting to
      come out with the party. John Hardy&#8217;s crowd <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_324"></a>324</span>was one of the
      gayest in town and they were very much grown up. But her outing the
      previous evening had given her a taste for grown-up things; she was eager
      for the lark and resolved to tease Frank to let her stay in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank studied the matter for several minutes, but finally consented rather
      reluctantly. He saw Sherm was also keen for the fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;All right, Sis, that set are pretty old for a kid like you and I&#8217;ll
      have a time squaring myself with Mother. But you don&#8217;t have many
      good times and Sherm&#8217;s steady enough to look after you. They are
      planning to start early. I guess you&#8217;ll get home by eight.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank left for the ranch about three o&#8217;clock to warn Marian of her
      surprise party. Mrs. Webb had insisted that Sherm stay with them for an
      early supper. The party had arranged to start at six. With a good team
      they should reach the ranch easily by eight, have two hours for
      merry-making, and get back to town by midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold had moderated through the day; by five o&#8217;clock, the sky was
      leaden gray and it looked like snow. Some of the fathers and mothers were
      doubtful as to whether they ought to risk so long a drive. But the weather
      was ideal, if it only didn&#8217;t snow, and there might not be another
      night during the holidays when they could all go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_325"></a>325</span>The
      expedition had bad luck from the start. The livery man, disliking the
      weather prospects, had had an inferior team harnessed to the big sled.
      John Hardy and the other young men stood for their rights and after a long
      wrangle, succeeded in getting what they wanted. But this had consumed
      precious time. They drove out of the livery barn at six-thirty instead of
      six, as they had intended. Then two or three of the girls were not ready.
      One of the last called for, having sat with her wraps on for over
      three-quarters of an hour, had finally removed them and her party frock as
      well, in disgust, thinking the jaunt had been given up on account of the
      weather. By the time she had dressed herself afresh it was a quarter past
      seven. There was still one young man to be picked up at the hotel. He,
      too, had grown tired of waiting and had started out to hunt the sleigh.
      Ten minutes more were consumed searching for him. The clock in the
      schoolhouse tower was striking the half hour as the sleigh load passed the
      last house in the little town, and turned into the country road leading to
      the ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm pulled out his watch. &#8220;Whew, Frank and Marian will have a nice
      wait for us! We can&#8217;t possibly make it till after nine.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next two miles went with a dash. The moonlight was a dim gray half
      light instead of the silvery radiance they had counted upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_326"></a>326</span>&#8220;Those
      clouds must be beastly heavy&#8211;there is scarcely a star to be seen,&#8221;
      ejaculated John Hardy, who was on the driver&#8217;s seat with a sprightly
      girl of nineteen for his companion. &#8220;What&#8217;ll you bet the snow
      catches us before we get home to-night?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you it catches us before we get out to Morton&#8217;s,&#8221;
      retorted one of the other young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad I am taking my turn at driving going out, if
      that&#8217;s the case. I shouldn&#8217;t like the job of keeping the road
      on these prairies in a nice blinding snowstorm.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s just because you&#8217;re a town dude,&#8221; said
      Grant Stowe boastfully. &#8220;It is just as easy to follow a country road
      as a street in town if you only know the country.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;All right, Grant, if it snows, we&#8217;ll let you drive home.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If it snows?&#8221; exclaimed one of the girls. &#8220;I felt a
      flake on my nose this very minute.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The party surveyed the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, you are just dreaming, Kate.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Somebody blew you a kiss and it cooled off on the way,&#8221;
      teased another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Just wait a minute, smarties. There&#8211;there was another!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I felt one, too!&#8221; exclaimed Mamie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s coming.&#8221; Sherm stared at the
      sky in some concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_327"></a>327</span>&#8220;Better
      whoop it right along, John,&#8221; advised one of the young men
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am not so sure that we shouldn&#8217;t be sensible to turn round
      and call this frolic off for to-night,&#8221; John Hardy replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a chorus of No&#8217;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Nonsense, who&#8217;s afraid of a little snow? Besides, we&#8217;d
      disappoint the Mortons and Jane&#8217;s mother would be frantic if she
      didn&#8217;t come. Don&#8217;t crawfish, John Hardy.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m equal to anything the rest of you are. I merely thought
      it might be rough on the girls, and occasion some alarm to other fond
      relatives in town, if we failed to get back to-night.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, stop your croaking!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There will be no trouble getting back.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Of course not, the horses can find the way if we can&#8217;t.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Here, start something to sing and shut off these ravens!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd sang lustily for the next twenty minutes, then the snow began
      coming down steadily and the majority of the young people commenced to
      disappear under the robes and blankets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The pesky stuff is getting inside my collar!&#8221; exclaimed one
      of the men who had insisted upon keeping his head out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_328"></a>328</span>&#8220;Why
      don&#8217;t you tear yourself from the scenery and come under cover?&#8221;
      asked Mamie pertly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Smith, I&#8217;m only holding one of Mamie&#8217;s hands. You
      may keep the other warm.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He&#8217;s not either. Don&#8217;t you believe him, Mr. Smith,&#8221;
      Mamie protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Hardy spoke to the girl beside him. He had been watching the road
      ahead too closely for several minutes to do any talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better go back with the others&#8211;there&#8217;s
      no need for you to get wet and cold.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I am all right&#8211;it isn&#8217;t cold&#8211;very.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am afraid it is going to be&#8211;the wind is rising and it&#8217;s
      coming right in our faces. We&#8217;re a pack of fools to go!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We must be nearly half way there, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I think so&#8211;I have never been out to the Morton ranch. Well,
      if worst comes to worst, I guess they&#8217;ll keep us all night.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd was beginning to quiet down. By the time they had covered two
      more miles the wind was blowing the snow in their faces with stinging
      force. John Hardy was having trouble to keep the horses in the road. They,
      too, recoiled from the snow drifting in their faces. He finally persuaded
      his companion to go back under the robes. Sherm volunteered to take her
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the look of things,&#8221; said Hardy in <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_329"></a>329</span>a low tone as Sherm
      climbed up beside him. &#8220;Can you tell where we are?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm stared at the snow-covered waste ahead and tried to recognize some
      familiar land mark in the white gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I think so. That was Elm Creek you crossed some time back. We
      must be about half way from Elm to Big John.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;How far now?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Three miles.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Can you see the time?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Nine-twenty.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The dickens, we ought to be there!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It oughtn&#8217;t to be long now. Let me take the reins&#8211;your
      hands must be cold.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Just a minute till I start the circulation. I feel sort of
      responsible for this gang, because I got up this fool enterprise.&#8221;
      Hardy clapped his hands together vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be bad except for the wind!&#8221; Hardy said
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s the worst of Kansas, there always is a wind!&#8221;
      Sherm had not yet been entirely converted to the charms of the sunflower
      state.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Hardy took the reins again, Sherm still peered ahead, watching the
      road. He had been finding something vaguely unfamiliar about the
      landscape, though this was not strange since neither house <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_330"></a>330</span>nor tree nor
      haystack was visible through the storm until they were almost upon it.
      Then it loomed up suddenly shrouded and spectral. This feeling of
      strangeness grew upon him and he felt uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Stop the team a minute, Hardy.&#8221; Sherm got down and went to
      the horses&#8217; heads, peering all about. He scraped the snow away with
      his foot and examined the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      He let out a shrill whistle of dismay, as he uncovered grass spears
      instead of the hard-trodden road bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Say, Hardy, we&#8217;re off the road. I thought so from the way the
      sled was dragging.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardy climbed hastily down with an exclamation that sounded profane. The
      boys in the sleigh also piled hurriedly out. They soon assured themselves
      of the sorrowful fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What can we do?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there a house somewhere near where we can inquire?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What did you fellows go to sleep for when you were driving, anyhow?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to go back on your tracks till you find the road
      again.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Questions and offers of advice were numerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm had walked a short distance back, exploring. He returned in time to
      hear this last remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The trouble is, Grant, the snow hasn&#8217;t left us <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_331"></a>331</span>any tracks. Two
      hundred yards back you can hardly see where we came.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The others began to wake to the seriousness of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you any idea where we are, Dart?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Not the faintest notion, except that we are somewhere between Elm
      and Big John. Perhaps Jane might know. She usually has a sixth sense for
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little,&#8221; he called, &#8220;do you mind getting out
      and seeing if you can tell us where we are?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was on the ground with a spring before Sherm could help
      her. She strained her eyes through the gloom. She, too, examined the
      ground, then, accompanied by Sherm and Hardy, waded through the snow for
      several hundred yards in each direction, the men kicking the snow in the
      hope of finding the track. Finally, Chicken Little gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know a blessed thing more than the rest of you. But I
      have the feeling we must be near Charlie Wattles&#8217; place&#8211;you
      know that old darkey. You see the wind was right in our faces most of the
      way, and it isn&#8217;t now. It&#8217;s coming obliquely&#8211;course the
      wind may have changed. Let&#8217;s try heading west a while&#8211;and see
      if we can find the road. Let me sit up there with you and Sherm; I might
      see something I&#8217;d recognize.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_332"></a>332</span>&#8220;Chicken
      Little, you&#8217;d freeze,&#8221; objected Sherm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Not any sooner than you will, Sherman Dart.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We can wrap her up in a blanket and she might help us&#8211;we have
      got to get out of this some way. It&#8217;s ten o&#8217;clock.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove about slowly for half an hour, but they could find nothing that
      looked like a road. Some of the sleigh load were openly apprehensive and
      inclined to blame Hardy for their plight, but for the most part they were
      plucky and good-natured, trying to turn off their growing fear with jests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little glued her eyes to the dimness ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm suggested that they give the horses their head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They&#8217;ll try to go back to town if we do, and I don&#8217;t
      believe they could hold out&#8211;that off one is blowing pretty badly
      now. This snow is heavy as mud to pull through.&#8221; Hardy looked
      dubious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Turn due west, Mr. Hardy&#8211;we can&#8217;t be far from Big John.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardy obeyed and they drove another half hour, seeing nothing save the
      fluttering snowflakes and the snowy wastes opening out a few feet ahead as
      they advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little, your theory is all right, but it doesn&#8217;t seem
      to work,&#8221; Sherm remarked regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_333"></a>333</span>In the
      meanwhile, time had also been moving along at the ranch. The big sitting
      room at the cottage was brightly lighted and glowingly warm from an open
      wood fire. By eight o&#8217;clock, coffee was steaming on the back of the
      kitchen stove, the extension table pulled out to its full length, was set
      with soup plates and cups and silver. Piles of doughnuts and baskets of
      apples and walnuts stood awaiting the sharp appetites the Mortons knew the
      cold ride would bring to them. Marian had the milk and oysters ready for
      the stew and sat down to rest a moment before the arrival of the guests.
      She hardly noticed the clock until the hand pointed to half-past eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My, they&#8217;re late!&#8221; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank got up and went to the door. He encountered Dr. Morton just coming
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;When did you say those youngsters were coming? It&#8217;s snowing
      like fury.&#8221; He paused on the porch to give himself another shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;ll try to come out to-night. I
      guess you&#8217;ve had all your trouble for nothing. I only wish Chicken
      Little and Sherm had come home with you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank, being a good many years nearer to understanding the rashness of
      youth than his father, disagreed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I bet they tried all right, but they may have had <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_334"></a>334</span>to give it up. I
      wonder how long it&#8217;s been snowing this way. I haven&#8217;t been out
      since supper.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton sat and visited for a half hour, then said he guessed he&#8217;d
      better go back to Mother. She was worrying a little about her baby being
      out such a night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;She needn&#8217;t,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;even a child like
      Jane would have sense enough not to start on a nine-mile ride in such
      weather.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      After his father had gone, Frank put on his coat and went down the lane
      with a lantern. He came back presently and sat down by the fire without
      saying anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian saw he was worried. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve got
      lost, do you, Frank?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to think. I hope Father is right and they
      had sense enough not to start. But I wish to goodness I hadn&#8217;t let
      Jane stay in.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat there listening for every sound until the clock struck ten. Frank
      had twice gone to the door, imagining he heard sleigh bells. He got to his
      feet again at the sound of the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You might as well go to bed, dear. We sha&#8217;n&#8217;t see them
      to-night, but I&#8217;ll sit up till eleven myself to make sure.&#8221;
    </p>

        A half hour later when they were warmed
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_335"></a>335</span>Marian waited
      a little while longer, then took his advice. Frank sat by the fire and
      pretended to read until five minutes of twelve, then he, too, gave up the
      vigil as hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten minutes past two they both sat up with a start at the sound of
      sleigh bells. An instant later there was a vigorous pounding on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank stared into the darkness for one confused instant, then leaped out
      of bed, and wrapping a dressing gown about him, flung open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twelve numbed and snow-covered figures stumbled into the room. Two of the
      men were half carrying one of the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Fire up quick, Frank, we&#8217;re most frozen! And get some hot
      water!&#8221; Sherm exclaimed, suiting the action to the word by stirring
      up the coals of the dying fire and piling on wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until a half hour later when they were warmed and fed, that the
      Mortons had time to listen to any connected account of the night&#8217;s
      adventures. Frank had speedily summoned his father to prescribe for
      frosted cheeks and fingers and toes. Later, it was discovered that John
      Hardy had a badly sprained wrist. Marian and Mrs. Morton made the girls
      comfortable and finished preparing the belated oyster supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am glad we didn&#8217;t lose this oyster supper altogether,&#8221;
      said Grant Stowe feelingly. &#8220;I never tasted anything better.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Same here,&#8221; a half dozen laughing voices echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_336"></a>336</span>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t
      so darned sure an hour ago that some of us were ever going to taste
      anything again,&#8221; said John Hardy soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Things didn&#8217;t look exactly rosy, specially when we got
      spilled out,&#8221; one of the girls added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What, did you have an upset?&#8221; Dr. Morton looked as if this
      were the last straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s how Hardy sprained his wrist!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little had just assured us that if we would drive a little
      farther west, we should surely find something, when we struck the sidehill
      and went over as neat as you please.&#8221; Mamie enjoyed this thrust at
      Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, we found something, didn&#8217;t we?&#8221; defended Sherm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I should say we found out how deep the snow was.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, and the sidehill made Jane sure we were near the creek, and
      then she saw the trees and&#8212;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, and then she found it wasn&#8217;t the creek at all, but the
      Wattles&#8217; place.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Whew!&#8221; exclaimed Frank, &#8220;you didn&#8217;t get over to
      black Charlie&#8217;s? Why, that was three miles out of your road!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Frank, and you ought to have seen him. He was scared to death
      when we came pounding on his door in the middle of the night.&#8221;
      Chicken Little giggled at the recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_337"></a>337</span>&#8220;And
      there was a trundle bed full of pickanninies and they kept popping their
      heads up. They were so ridiculous&#8211;with their little pigtails
      sticking up all over their heads, and their bead eyes.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, old Charlie warmed us up all right and started us back on the
      road again,&#8221; said John Hardy gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And there&#8217;s another thing sure,&#8221; said Marian,
      interrupting this flow of reminiscence, &#8220;you can&#8217;t go back to
      town to-night, and you must be tired to death, all of you. Mother Morton,
      if you will take the girls over with you, Frank and I will make some
      pallets by the fire for these boys, and let them get some sleep.&#8221;
    </p>
    <hr style="border:none; border-bottom:1px solid silver; height: 1px; width: 80%; text-align: center; margin: 10px auto;" />
    <p>
      The real sport of this excursion came the next day when Frank Morton
      hitched an extra team on in front of the livery horses and drove the party
      back to town himself, to make sure they did not come to grief again in the
      piled-up drifts. But Chicken Little and Sherm were not along. They watched
      them drive off with never a pang of envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I have had enough bobsled riding to do me for this winter,&#8221;
      said Jane wearily. Her evening at Fatinitza seemed a thousand years away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Ditto, yours truly!&#8221; And Sherm yawned luxuriously.

    <h2>
      AN APRIL FOOL FROLIC
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton and Marian were sitting by the great open fire at the cottage
      sewing for Jilly. Jilly herself had constructed a wonderful vehicle of two
      chairs hitched to the center table, and she was vainly trying to persuade
      Huz and Buz to occupy seats in this luxurious equipage. Lazy Buz, having
      once been dragged up into a chair, stayed put, though he looked aggrieved,
      but Huz had his eye on the braided rag rug in front of the fireplace. The
      moment Jilly&#8217;s gaze was attracted elsewhere, he would jump softly
      down and curl up on the rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian had risen three times to restore him to Jilly because she mourned
      so loudly, but she finally began to sympathize with the pup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Let him be, Honey, you&#8217;ve got Buz for company. Huz doesn&#8217;t
      want to play.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_339"></a>339</span>Jilly opened
      her mouth to wail. Then she suddenly changed her mind, climbed down, and
      going over to Huz began whispering vigorously into his ear. Her warm
      breath tickled Huz and he flopped his ear to drive away the annoying
      insect. Jilly beamed, calling joyfully to her mother: &#8220;Huz say ess,
      Mamma, Huz say ess.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But Jilly, Huz can&#8217;t talk.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He nod he&#8217;s ear, Mamma. Huz nod he&#8217;s ear.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate Huz went up into the chair once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton glanced out the window where the March wind was whipping the
      bare branches of the cherry trees into mournful complaining. Eddying
      leaves fluttered from the heaps accumulated in fence corners or beneath
      the friendly shelter of the evergreens. A huge tumble weed went whirling
      down the road, passed on by each succeeding gust. In and out of the
      cedars, the robins were flying, prospecting for new nests. She pushed back
      her hair and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem possible that April is almost here. Ernest
      has been gone nearly a school year. I am beginning to realize that I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t
      see much more of my boy.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But, Mother Morton, he is doing so beautifully and he likes the
      life. You couldn&#8217;t keep him with <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_340"></a>340</span>you much longer, even if he were not in the
      academy. Besides, you still have Jane.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton sighed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That is the worst of this ranch life. Jane is growing so fast I
      shall soon have to be sending her away to school. If we only lived some
      place where she could be right with me till she finished her education.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, Mother Morton, I am glad she can&#8217;t. It is the best part
      of a girl&#8217;s education to go away from all the home coddling and have
      to rely upon herself. I wouldn&#8217;t give anything for what I learned by
      being away from family and friends, and having to exert myself to make
      people like me, instead of taking it for granted.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt what you say is true, Marian, but Ernest is
      gone, and you don&#8217;t know what a wrench it is going to be to send my
      baby away, too.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Are you thinking of sending her next year?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I think I must, unless I can persuade Father to move to town for
      the winter so she can go to the High School. It isn&#8217;t merely the
      studies&#8211;I am most dissatisfied with her associations here.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know&#8211;the Creek is certainly a little crude. Still I think
      Jane is pretty sensible. And she is learning a lot about human nature&#8211;human
      nature without its party clothes. It&#8217;s good for her, Mother, if she
      doesn&#8217;t get too much of it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_341"></a>341</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s
      good for whom?&#8221; Dr. Morton, coming in, was attracted by Marian&#8217;s
      earnest tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Jane, and the effect District Thirteen is having on her,&#8221;
      Marian explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I was just saying, Father, that she is getting too old to be
      associating with Tom, Dick, and Harry the way she is doing up at the
      schoolhouse.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There you go again, Mother. You don&#8217;t go about enough among
      the neighbors to know what good kindly people they are. Of course, they
      are plain, but the Tom, Dick, and Harry you complain of, are more
      wholesome than lots of more stylish youngsters I know. I wish you&#8217;d
      try to be a little more neighborly. I am constantly hearing little thrusts
      about our family being stuck up. Frank will bear me out in this.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank had followed his father and was warming his hands in the blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, the Creek thinks the Morton family has a good opinion of
      itself, all right. But I have been thinking for some time that it wouldn&#8217;t
      hurt us any to have some sort of a merry-making and invite all the
      neighbors in.&#8221; Frank looked at Marian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What could we have, Frank?&#8221; Marian inquired, her brow
      puckered a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, April Fool&#8217;s Day is next Wednesday&#8211;why not get up
      a frolic for that evening?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Just for the young folks?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_342"></a>342</span>&#8220;No,
      men, women, and children. Invite the families. Send out an invitation to
      the whole Creek. There will be a lot who can&#8217;t come. Cook up plenty
      of stuff and we can play tricks&#8211;they won&#8217;t need much
      entertaining. How would that suit you, Chicken Little?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane had just strayed in to join the family group and was listening with
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I think it would be bully.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Jane, where did you pick up such a coarse expression? Father, that&#8217;s
      just what I complain of. How am I to teach my daughter to be a gentle
      woman, when she is constantly hearing vulgar language?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little is old enough to know better than to use such words,
      but she probably got that from Ernest or Sherm, if the truth were known.&#8221;
      Frank laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little looked injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, bully isn&#8217;t a by-word&#8211;or strong language&#8211;and
      Ernest said it a lot. You never said anything to him about it&#8217;s
      being vulgar.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My dear daughter, can I never make you understand that little
      ladies may not do everything their brothers do?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t care, Mother, I&#8217;m sick of hearing about ladies,
      and if bully is so vulgar, I don&#8217;t see why it isn&#8217;t vulgar
      when a boy says it. You expect Ernest <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_343"></a>343</span>to be a gentleman, don&#8217;t you, just as
      much as you do me to be a lady?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Come, Chicken Little, don&#8217;t speak to your mother that way,&#8221;
      Dr. Morton reproved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton was more severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You may go to your room and remain until you can address your
      mother respectfully, my daughter.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank&#8217;s plan was carried out. There were no formal invitations
      issued. Frank and Dr. Morton and Jim Bart spoke to every neighbor they met
      for the next few days, inviting them to come to an April Fool frolic at
      seven on the evening of April first, and asking them to pass the
      invitation along to the other residents of Big John. Chicken Little and
      Sherm rode over to give Captain Clarke a special invitation, fearing he
      might not have become sufficiently used to Creek ways to come on the more
      general bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain was charmed and begged leave to send Wing over to help that
      evening. Wing delighted in every new experience he was having on the
      Creek. He grinned joyously at the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire Morton family entered into the preparations for this novel
      party with enthusiasm. Even Jilly and Huz and Buz caught the excitement of
      something unusual going on, and hung round, and got under everybody&#8217;s
      feet, more successfully than usual. Jilly had the privilege of scraping
      icing bowls <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_344"></a>344</span>while
      Huz and Buz looked enviously on. They licked their sticky chops
      ecstatically when Jilly turned the bowl over to them after she had done
      her best with the big tin spoon. Her mother reproached her for letting the
      pups eat out of one of the family dishes, but Jilly couldn&#8217;t see why
      her mother was so particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton and Annie and Marian baked cakes and doughnuts and cookies and
      mince pies and custard pies, and roasted turkeys and whole hams, until
      pantry and cellar and spring house were all overflowing. It would be a
      never-ending reproach, if there should not be an abundance for all who
      might come, and no one could even guess how many would come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like enough for a regiment,&#8221; said Mrs. Morton
      wearily, dropping into a rocking chair on the afternoon of the
      thirty-first day of March.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, but country men do have such astonishing appetites. I am sure
      it would feed all Centerville for twenty-four hours. Of course, some of
      the things are not eatable,&#8221; Marian replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had carried out the April Fool idea as much as possible without
      spoiling the supper. Six nice brown doughnuts had wads of cotton concealed
      in their tempting rings. These were to be mixed with the good ones.
      Pickles just out of the brine, were to be put in the same dish with
      deliciously perfect <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_345"></a>345</span>ones.
      There was to be just enough of the false to keep the guests on the alert
      and make fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were sitting there resting, Frank and Dr. Morton came in from a
      trip to town. Frank tossed a package into Marian&#8217;s lap with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;These ought to do the work for somebody. I&#8217;d like to fool old
      Jake Schmidt. It would be worth ten dollars to see his face&#8211;he is
      such a screw about driving a bargain.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian untied the string and opened the parcel, revealing a handful of the
      most luscious-looking little cucumber pickles that ever lured the unwary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;They certainly look all right,&#8221; said Marian, &#8220;what&#8217;s
      the matter with them&#8211;salt?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Feel them.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian picked one up gingerly as if she were afraid it might prick her or
      explode in her hand. Then she threw back her head and laughed merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Frank, they are just perfect. I never should have guessed it. You
      can fetch Jake all right with one of these. Let me know when you do, I&#8217;d
      like to be round to see the fun.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you afraid you will hurt somebody&#8217;s feelings
      with all these pranks? They don&#8217;t seem quite dignified some way for
      grown up people.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s just why we want to have them, Mother. The Creek
      thinks the Morton family is entirely too <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_346"></a>346</span>grown up and stiff. They&#8217;ll be
      good-natured, never fear.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Chicken Little and Sherm put their heads together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;We just must find some way to fool Frank&#8211;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t
      be happy if we don&#8217;t.&#8221; Chicken Little bit her lips and
      studied. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you think of something, Sherm?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Not right off the bat, but if we keep our eyes open, we&#8217;ll
      find a way. It would be jolly if we could do it before the crowd. They
      would so love to see Frank have to take his own medicine. Say, this party
      is going to be a Jim dandy!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been decided to have the gathering at the cottage, as the big
      sitting room and the bedroom adjoining would hold more people than Mrs.
      Morton&#8217;s parlor, sitting room, and dining-room all three. Further,
      the parlor, being separated from the other rooms by a short hallway, was
      of use only for some little group who wished to be by themselves. Sherm
      and Chicken Little were busy all day trimming up the pictures and the
      windows with evergreen and bitter sweet berries, mixed with trailers from
      the Japanese honeysuckle, which still showed green underneath where it had
      escaped the hardest freezes. Marian flitted in occasionally with
      suggestions, but the two did most of the work alone. Chicken Little began
      by giving Sherm precise directions as to how <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_347"></a>347</span>he was to arrange each branch and spray, but,
      presently, he began to try little effects of his own so much more charming
      than hers, that she called Marian in to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You certainly have a knack for decoration, Sherm. I never dreamed
      you were artistic. Why didn&#8217;t you tell us? That spray against the
      curtain is exquisite. Have you ever taken drawing lessons?&#8221; Marian
      was both surprised and interested to discover this unexpected talent in
      the self-contained lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, I have never taken real drawing&#8211;I used to copy little
      geometrical designs at school along with the rest.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, you surely ought to have lessons. I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if
      you had the making of an artist in you.&#8221; Marian hurried back to her
      custards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little went on tying evergreen into ropes, but Marian had put
      several new ideas into her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you want to be an artist, Sherm?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, I want to be an architect.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You never said anything about it before.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;s the use of talking? Doesn&#8217;t look as if I would
      ever get the education to be one now.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, you can&#8217;t tell. Even if your father can&#8217;t send
      you, maybe you could work your own way&#8211;Mr. Clay has.&#8221; Chicken
      Little looked troubled; Sherm&#8217;s tone revealed a yearning she had not
      suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_348"></a>348</span>&#8220;Yes, I
      could work my way if I had the chance. I guess Father is never going to be
      well again and&#8212;&#8221; He paused for a moment as if it were hard to
      go on. &#8220;Even if he lives, I may have to keep at work to support the
      family. Mother never says anything, and Father never told me much about
      his business&#8211;I don&#8217;t know how much we have, but I&#8217;m
      afraid there isn&#8217;t a great deal left.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a hopeless ring in his voice that hurt Chicken Little. She
      wanted to double up her fist and attack somebody or something in Sherm&#8217;s
      behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I think they&#8211;your mother ought to tell you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, Mother doesn&#8217;t realize I am most grown&#8211;she&#8211;she
      doesn&#8217;t think I amount to much I guess.&#8221; The boy had been
      brooding; his manhood affronted because he had not been permitted to share
      in the family councils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t feel that way&#8211;she doesn&#8217;t mean to leave you
      out, Sherm. You know it&#8217;s awfully hard to write things and you have
      been away most a year.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s just it. I&#8217;ve been away most a year, and Mother
      doesn&#8217;t even hint at my coming back!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But Sherm, she&#8217;s so worried all the time about your father.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;All the same, I bet your mother wouldn&#8217;t forget about Ernest
      if your father was ill. I am the only boy in the family and I know I could
      help, if they&#8217;d <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_349"></a>349</span>only
      trust me. It&#8217;s being left out that hurts, Chicken Little. But forget
      everything I&#8217;ve said. I didn&#8217;t mean to blab this way. I s&#8217;pose
      Mother&#8217;s right&#8211;I can&#8217;t even keep my own affairs to
      myself.&#8221; Sherm shut his lips together tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane tactfully changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;d have to know a lot to be an architect.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, right smart&#8211;I&#8217;d need a college education, and then
      I&#8217;d like to go to Paris and study at the Beaux Arts.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a school for architects and artists. I don&#8217;t
      know very much about it myself. The New York architect who designed the
      new court house at home told me I ought to go there, if I ever wanted to
      be a real honest to goodness architect. I had a talk with him one day. He
      said if I ever got ready to go, to write to him, and he would give me some
      letters to people in Paris.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My, wouldn&#8217;t that be grand to study in Paris? I most wish I
      was a boy&#8211;they can do such wonderful things.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The neighborhood gatherings began early. By half-past seven, hitching
      posts and trees and fence were all in use for the teams. Frank was
      pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;If there is anything in numbers, this party is <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_350"></a>350</span>going to be a
      success. Sure you have plenty to eat?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian groaned. &#8220;Frank, I am dead sure we have all the food we can
      possibly serve between now and midnight. I don&#8217;t see how we are ever
      to manage.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll impress about a dozen of the young
      folks as waiters&#8211;they will like nothing better. The boys each have
      one more pair of hands than they know what to do with. Look at the Raddon
      boys over by the fireplace. They have put their hands in their pockets,
      and taken them out, and dropped them by their sides, and picked up every
      bit of bric-a-brac on the mantel, and smoothed back their hair, and Heaven
      knows what else, during the last ten minutes. Hands are an awful
      responsibility! It will be a Godsend to them to give them something to do.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little came out, after helping with wraps and seating guests, in a
      gale of merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, Marian, do take a peep at Mrs. Brown. She has a purple skirt
      and a blue polonaise and a red bow on her hair, and she&#8217;s got her
      hair banged in front and pulled back tight as can be behind.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Hush, Jane, they&#8217;re our guests.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know, and I didn&#8217;t mean to be making fun&#8211;but Marian,
      she&#8217;s a sight! And Jake Schmidt&#8217;s wife and sister have the
      loveliest hand embroidered caps <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_351"></a>351</span>and aprons, with exquisite lace, that they
      brought from the old country, and some of the other women are sort of
      turning up their noses at them. I wish you&#8217;d go and say something
      extra nice to them.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian found her way to where Christine and Johanna Schmidt were shrinking
      into a corner, painfully aware that their festal dress was very different
      from their neighbors&#8217;. Marian asked after the children and said one
      or two pleasant things to make them feel at home, then, raising her voice
      a trifle so that the whole room might hear, she lifted a corner of Johanna&#8217;s
      apron, exclaiming: &#8220;Where did you get this exquisite apron? I don&#8217;t
      believe I have ever seen such a beautiful one. May I look at the lace?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Johanna colored with pleasure. She forgot her shyness and explained
      eagerly. Marian did not leave her until she had made every woman in that
      part of the room admire both hers and Christine&#8217;s old country
      handiwork, and they had promised to show her how to make the lace. There
      was no more smiling at their unusual dress. Others followed Marian&#8217;s
      example in asking to be taught the beautiful craft. Old Jake himself, who
      had never before considered his women folk as amounting to much, was so
      gratified by the attention they were receiving, that he was more offensive
      than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Frank, &#8220;I&#8217;ll fix Jake.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The early part of the evening passed in visiting <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_352"></a>352</span>and games. Supper
      was served at ten. There was a stir when the refreshments appeared. Word
      had gone about that there was to be some hoaxing in connection with the
      supper and everybody was firmly resolved not to be fooled. Marian allayed
      suspicion by starting them off with delicious coffee and rolls and cold
      ham and turkey. Having tasted these gingerly, and found them delicious,
      both young and old grew less wary. Chicken Little came in demurely with a
      great dish of pickles. The Creek loved pickles. It helped itself
      plentifully. Captain Clarke got the first taste of brine, but after one
      surprised grimace, he went on eating it heroically, while he watched the
      others. Old Jake promptly fixed his eye on a nice firm-looking green one.
      He lifted the fork awkwardly and attempted to take the pickle. The pickle
      slid from under the fork as if it had been greased. Jake was terribly
      afraid of being a laughing stock; he glanced slily around to see if any
      one had noticed. Frank was watching from the opposite side of the room,
      but Jake did not see him. He grasped the fork firmly in his great fist and
      speared the pickle as if he had been harpooning a fish. The pickle
      resented such violence. It shot out of the dish and half way across the
      room with old Jake, the fork still clenched firmly, gazing stupidly after
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;April Fool, Jake!&#8221; called one of the men who saw the joke.
      Some one picked up the pickle and <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_353"></a>353</span>passed it from hand to hand. After that,
      people avoided the wooden pickles, but several took liberal bites of
      brine-steeped ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fun was well under way by this time. So many people had been
      victimized that many refused the dainties they coveted, for fear of being
      deceived, only to find their next neighbor enjoying them. The guests began
      to try to catch each other, and the young men would get Marian to point
      out the traps. But, so far, Frank had escaped, though Sherm and Chicken
      Little had been plotting all day. They took Captain Clarke into their
      confidence, but even he failed, until he had the happy thought of getting
      Wing to help. Wing had been working busily in the kitchen assisting Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank had steadily refused cotton wool doughnuts and sanded pie and every
      doubtful delicacy, but he was extremely fond of cup custard. When Wing
      approached him, urging that he be served now, Frank hesitated a moment,
      then said: &#8220;Just bring me a custard, Wing. And Wing, don&#8217;t let
      anybody meddle with it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Wing came grinning to the conspirators.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; said Chicken Little, &#8220;I think the custards
      are all right.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian overheard. &#8220;Trust me, Chicken Little, I have one very special
      one for Frank&#8211;I didn&#8217;t intend to have him crowing.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_354"></a>354</span>Wing bore in
      a most tempting custard. Frank inspected it carefully to make sure it had
      not been tampered with. In so doing he attracted the attention of those
      round him. He took a generous spoonful and made a hasty dive for the
      kitchen amid lively applause from the whole room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What was in it?&#8221; The Captain was still shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mustard&#8211;Marian made it bad enough so he couldn&#8217;t hide
      it!&#8221; Chicken Little was dancing up and down in glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Wing, you rascal, I&#8217;d like to choke you.&#8221; Frank was
      still sputtering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wing assumed a mournful expression. &#8220;Me velly sorry&#8211;nobody
      touch, samee you say.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the second of April before the last rattle of wheels died away down
      the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, Mother, I think it paid for the trouble,&#8221; said Dr.
      Morton, as they were starting homeward, his arms laden with chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, I guess, perhaps, I have been inclined to stand too much
      aloof. That little Mrs. Anderson is really a cultured woman. She comes
      from Maine. I asked her to come and spend the day Tuesday.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marian&#8217;s comment was brief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Frank, I am dead, but I&#8217;m glad we did it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;So am I&#8211;put out the light.&#8221; Frank was already half
      asleep.

    <h2>
      SHERM HEARS BAD NEWS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherm, don&#8217;t you just love this room?&#8221; Chicken Little
      gazed about Captain Clarke&#8217;s big library with a real affection.
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why it is, but this room makes me feel the same
      way a sunset, or the prairie when it&#8217;s all in bloom, does. I can&#8217;t
      just tell you, but it makes me so satisfied with everything ... as if the
      world was so beautiful it couldn&#8217;t possibly be very bad.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know&#8211;it&#8217;s the harmony, like in music. The colors all
      seem to go together ... everything seems to belong. I like that, too, but
      it doesn&#8217;t mean just that, to me. I see the Captain every time I
      step in here. It&#8217;s a part of him&#8211;almost as if he had worked
      his own bigness and the kind of things he loves, into furniture and books
      and&#8211;fixings.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s so much room to breathe here&#8211;I <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_356"></a>356</span>s&#8217;pose being
      at sea so much, he had to have that. And he picked up most of these things
      on his voyages&#8211;he must have wanted them pretty bad or he wouldn&#8217;t
      have carried them half around the world with him.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people had come over to the Captain&#8217;s for supper. School
      had closed the day before, and Chicken Little was the proud possessor of
      an elaborate autograph album, won as a spelling prize. Captain Clarke had
      attended the closing exercises at her request. He had invited them over to
      celebrate, this evening. He declared he had never learned to spell himself
      and he wanted the honor of entertaining some one who knew how.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little had brought the album along for the Captain&#8217;s
      signature. &#8220;And write something, too, won&#8217;t you? Something
      specially for me,&#8221; she had begged winningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Have they all written something&#8211;specially for you, Chicken
      Little? I should like to read them.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I haven&#8217;t asked very many people yet, just Mr. Clay and Grant
      Stowe and Mamie Jenkins&#8217; little sister&#8211;Mamie&#8217;s in town
      you know. I asked Sherm, but he hasn&#8217;t thought up anything.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain glanced at Sherm and smiled whimsically. &#8220;Now, if I were
      as young as Sherm, I shouldn&#8217;t have to think up things&#8211;the
      trouble would be to restrain my eloquence.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_357"></a>357</span>Sherm grinned
      and looked uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain was merciful; he changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Isn&#8217;t the middle of May a little early to close school?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, it is the usual time. You see the older children have to help
      at home as soon as the weather gets warm.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Of course. What are you going to do this summer?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Wish Ernest was home,&#8221; Jane answered pertly, but there was a
      wistful look in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the Captain could reply, Wing came to the door to announce a man to
      see him. The Captain was gone some time. When he returned, he explained
      that it was a buyer from Kansas City after his corn, and he should have to
      leave them to entertain themselves for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what you can do,&#8221; he paused in the
      doorway as the idea occurred to him. &#8220;You two may rummage in the
      drawers of the cabinet. Take out anything you like the looks of. I think
      you will find a lot of interesting stuff there. Make yourselves at home.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They lingered, discussing the room for several minutes after his
      departure, then Jane went over to the cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Come on&#8211;there are heaps of wonderful things <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_358"></a>358</span>here. He showed me
      some of them the day I ran off and came to see him on my own hook. That&#8217;s
      a year ago! My, I feel as if it were a dozen&#8211;it seems as if I were
      just a little girl then.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And now?&#8221; Sherm adored to set Jane off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;None of your sarcasm, Mr. Dart.&#8221; Then soberly: &#8220;Truly,
      Sherm, I know I&#8217;m a lot older. Things seem so different to me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know you are, too, Lady Jane. I was only teasing you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a beautiful half hour among the Captain&#8217;s treasures. Sherm
      gloated especially over the prints&#8211;their wonderful composition and
      soft color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Say, the Japs know a thing or two, don&#8217;t they? That wouldn&#8217;t
      be my idea of what to put into a picture, but it&#8217;s awfully
      satisfying.&#8221; He held the print off and closed one eye to see the
      outlines more vividly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherm, you surely were intended for an artist.&#8221; Chicken
      Little had gone on to the drawer below. &#8220;Oh, Sherm, I believe this
      is the drawer the Captain didn&#8217;t show me before. Do you suppose he
      wants us to go through it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He said all of them. What&#8217;s in it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, sashes and scarfs and things. I thought maybe they used to
      belong to his wife.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm lifted a Roman scarf of crimson and yellow and rich blue, and
      examined it admiringly. &#8220;It <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_359"></a>359</span>doesn&#8217;t look as if this had ever been
      worn. I guess he wouldn&#8217;t have told us to go ahead if there had been
      anything here he didn&#8217;t want us to find. Say, Chicken Little, this
      would look dandy on you. Here, I&#8217;m going to fix you up for Captain
      Clarke to see.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm shook out the glowing silken folds and proceeded to wreathe the
      scarf around Chicken Little&#8217;s head, turban fashion. Her brown eyes
      glowed and the color in her cheeks grew deeper, as she met the admiration
      in Sherm&#8217;s eyes. He was staring at her, enchanted at the result of
      his efforts. Jane moved restlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Hold still there, can&#8217;t you? I want to try it another way.
      Didn&#8217;t I see one of those sleeveless jacket affairs in there?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane rummaged and brought to light a crimson silk Turkish jacket
      embroidered in gold thread. She noticed that it, too, seemed perfectly
      fresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherm, I do wonder how Captain Clarke happened to buy all these
      woman&#8217;s things. Do you suppose he bought them for his wife and she
      was dead when he got home with them?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I wonder. Perhaps we oughtn&#8217;t to be handling them. See all
      those queer beads, and there&#8217;s a bracelet! Isn&#8217;t it a beauty?
      See, it is like silver lace. I guess those blue stones must be turquoises.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it dainty? That must be the filigree work we read
      about.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_360"></a>360</span>Sherm was
      staring thoughtfully at the contents of the drawer. &#8220;One thing sure,&#8221;
      he muttered, &#8220;he must have thought a heap of her.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little had continued exploring. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a photograph
      and two locks of hair in a little frame. Oh, Sherm, it&#8217;s her! Yes,
      it must be, this is the same baby. I wonder why he doesn&#8217;t have this
      on his bureau, too.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm took the picture and stared at it so long that Jane grew impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;What is it, Sherm? What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm started, passing his hand over his forehead and eyes as if he were
      dazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Funny, the face seems sort of familiar. I had such a queer feeling
      about it for a minute.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I know why it looks familiar&#8211;there&#8217;s a tiny bit of
      resemblance to you&#8211;not as much as in the pictures of the baby. I
      suppose the baby got it from the mother. Still, I think it looks like
      Captain Clarke, too, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s put these things back, Chicken Little. Poor little
      lady, I wonder what happened to her.&#8221; Sherm laid the picture gently
      back in the bottom of the drawer and helped Jane fold and lay away the
      other things. They had both forgotten the Roman sash which still adorned
      her dark hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke, coming in soon after, started when he saw her and glanced
      at the cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_361"></a>361</span>&#8220;Dressing
      up, Chicken Little? That gew gaw was evidently intended by Providence for
      you. Won&#8217;t you accept it as a present to keep that autograph album
      company?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little put her hand to her head in dismay. Captain Clarke must
      have thought she wanted it. She stammered awkwardly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, Captain Clarke&#8211;I&#8211;couldn&#8217;t take it. I oughtn&#8217;t
      to have put it on.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm calmly took the matter out of her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;She didn&#8217;t put it on, Captain Clarke. I&#8217;m the guilty
      party. I thought it would be so becoming to Chicken Little&#8211;her dark
      hair and eyes&#8211;you know. I didn&#8217;t realize till we came across
      the picture that it belonged to your wife&#8211;and&#8211;you might not
      like to have us handle it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It was never Mrs. Clarke&#8217;s,&#8221; the Captain said evenly.
      &#8220;I bought it for her, but she&#8221;&#8211;he hesitated an instant&#8211;&#8220;she&#8211;died
      before my return. I told you to rummage the drawers, and that scarf is
      entirely too becoming to Chicken Little&#8217;s bright eyes to be wasted
      in a drawer any longer. You will be doing me a favor, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You seem to have an eye for color, Sherm. Juanita loved color, too,
      that is why I picked up so many gay things for her.&#8221; Captain Clarke
      seemed to have formed a sudden resolution. He plunged his hand down among
      the rustling silks and brought up <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a
      id="page_362"></a>362</span>the picture. His hand trembled a little as he
      handed it to Chicken Little. &#8220;I have never shown you her picture
      before. She had eyes something like yours.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little took the picture and tried to look as if nothing had
      happened. She described the scene to Marian afterwards. &#8220;O Marian, I
      felt as if I were standing in a story book. The Captain&#8217;s face was
      as white, but he went on talking just as if I knew all about his wife, and&#8211;I
      do wonder! I felt so sorry for him. Sherm said he wanted to kick himself
      for being so thoughtless.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it, Jane, and don&#8217;t be trying to make
      a mystery out of what was merely a big sorrow. It must have been an awful
      blow to him to come home and find wife and baby both dead, but it happened
      years ago. I expect it did him good to talk to you and Sherm about it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little forgot about it after a few days, except when she went to
      the box where she kept the scarf. She always thought of the picture of the
      young mother and baby whenever she saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I ever can wear it,&#8221; she told Sherm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, yes, you will, some of these days; the Captain would be hurt if
      you didn&#8217;t.&#8221;
    </p>
    <hr style="border:none; border-bottom:1px solid silver; height: 1px; width: 80%; text-align: center; margin: 10px auto;" />
    <p>
      Sherm hadn&#8217;t heard from his mother for over a week when a neighbor
      came one evening and handed <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_363"></a>363</span>Dr.
      Morton a yellow envelope. &#8220;No bad news, I hope,&#8221; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was addressed to Dr. Morton and read: &#8220;My husband died this
      morning. Break news to Sherm&#8211;he must await letter.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm, too, was older than he had been a year before. He was coming up the
      lane whistling, swinging his supple young body along at a good pace, as if
      he enjoyed being alive. Dr. Morton watched him, dreading to have to tell
      him the bad news and wondering how he would take it. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
      pity,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;Sherm&#8217;s a fine manly fellow and
      ought to have his education and a chance at life, and I am afraid this
      means more than losing his father.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited until the boy came up to him. He was still holding the telegram
      in his hand, but Sherm did not notice it until he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton&#8217;s voice was very kind. &#8220;My boy, I am&#8211;afraid&#8212;&#8221;
      He got no farther. Sherm saw the telegram and understood. &#8220;Father?&#8221;
      he questioned. Dr. Morton nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm stood motionless, as if he were trying to realize that the blow he
      had so long dreaded, had fallen. Presently he looked up at the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There isn&#8217;t any train before to-morrow, is there?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, Sherm, and I don&#8217;t think your mother expects&#8211;here,
      read the message.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_364"></a>364</span>Sherm&#8217;s
      hand shook. He read the meager words through twice, then crushed the paper
      in his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am going home to-morrow,&#8221; he said doggedly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
      got enough saved up for the railroad fare. He was my father&#8211;I haven&#8217;t
      seen him for a year. They might have told me! I am not a child any longer!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton laid his hand on his shoulder. &#8220;Don&#8217;t, Sherm&#8211;don&#8217;t
      add bitterness to grief. Your mother may not have known in time. Death
      often comes suddenly at the last in such cases. And, my boy, I would think
      twice before setting out rashly. Your mother asks you to wait for her
      letter&#8211;she must have some good reason. The message was sent this
      morning. There will probably be a letter to-morrow.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t care whether there&#8217;s a letter or not, I&#8217;m
      going.&#8221; There was a hard look on the boy&#8217;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little came running up, with Jilly panting alongside. &#8220;My,
      we had a good race, didn&#8217;t we, Jilly Dilly? Why&#8211;what&#8217;s&#8212;&#8221;
      She stopped short at sight of their grave faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood a moment awestruck; Chicken Little had never had death come so
      near her before. Then she turned to Sherm, her face so full of tender pity
      that his face softened a trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me, Chicken Little,&#8221; he said <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_365"></a>365</span>gruffly, &#8220;I
      am all right. If you&#8217;ll help me knock my things together after a
      while, I&#8217;ll be grateful. I guess I&#8217;ll take a&#8211;walk&#8211;now.&#8221;
      His voice broke a little at the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not wait for an answer, but walked hurriedly away. Jane gazed after
      him, undecided whether to follow or not. Dr. Morton divined her thought.
      &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t, dear. Let him have it out alone first&#8211;you
      can comfort him later on. I want you to help me persuade him not to rush
      off before he receives his mother&#8217;s letter. I must say I don&#8217;t
      blame Sherm for resenting his mother&#8217;s attitude. I think she is
      making a big mistake.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dusk came and the darkness closed round while Chicken Little strained her
      eyes in vain for Sherm. It was almost ten before he came back. She was
      standing at the gate watching for him. The rest of the family had gone to
      bed. &#8220;Chicken Little can comfort him better than any of us,&#8221;
      Dr. Morton had told his wife. &#8220;He will be glad not to have to face
      any of the rest of the family to-night.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have stayed up, Chicken Little,&#8221; Sherm
      called, as soon as he caught sight of her. &#8220;I forgot I asked you to
      help me&#8211;I&#8217;d have come home sooner if I&#8217;d remembered. The
      duds can wait till morning&#8211;I can get up early.&#8221; He spoke
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Do you think you ought to go, Sherm?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm&#8217;s eyes smouldered. Jane could not see him <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_366"></a>366</span>very distinctly,
      but she could fairly feel his determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s no use talking, I&#8217;m going!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They went up the walk in silence. The lilacs and the white syringia in the
      borders were in bloom. She hoped Sherm did not notice the heavy fragrance&#8211;it
      was so like a funeral. He did not say anything till they got to the foot
      of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, Jane, for&#8211;for waiting.&#8221; His voice broke
      pitifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Morton discovered the next morning that Sherm was not to be moved
      from his purpose, he decided to go into town early and see if by any
      chance there might be another telegram or a letter. Letters from the east
      sometimes came down by a branch line from the north. There was nothing,
      and he finally resolved to telegraph Mrs. Dart as to Sherm&#8217;s state
      of mind. Sherm was to come later in the day with Frank in time to catch
      the evening train, which was the only one that made close connections at
      Kansas City. It was late afternoon before he received a reply. The message
      was emphatic. &#8220;Sherm <i>must</i> await letter.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Mrs. Dart evidently knows her own mind,&#8221; thought the Doctor.
      He drove a little way out of town and waited for Frank and Sherm. Chicken
      Little was with them. He gave the boy this second message, explaining what
      he had done. Sherm read <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_367"></a>367</span>it
      over and over, as if he hoped in some way to find a reason for his mother&#8217;s
      decision lurking between the lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he said stolidly: &#8220;I&#8217;ll wait till to-morrow. Perhaps
      the letter will come to-night.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked it over and Sherm and Chicken Little went on to town with the
      light buggy to wait for the mail, while Dr. Morton and Frank drove home.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a handful of letters in the box. Sherm took them out hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I guess this is it,&#8221; he said, stuffing one into his pocket.
      &#8220;And here&#8217;s three for you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Three? Whoever from?&#8221; Jane held out her hand. &#8220;Ernest
      and Katy&#8211;and here&#8217;s another with an Annapolis postmark. Who do
      you suppose?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm glanced over her shoulder. &#8220;That&#8217;s Carol Brown&#8217;s
      handwriting.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Carol?&#8211;writing to me? How funny!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They hurried out to the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Let me drive while you read your letter, Sherm.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm shook his head. &#8220;Read yours first&#8211;this will keep.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The idea&#8211;I wouldn&#8217;t be so piggy selfish.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Please, Jane, I&#8217;d rather get out of town before I tackle it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherm, I wish I could&#8212;&#8221; She didn&#8217;t need to
      finish. Sherm understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Read Carol&#8217;s first,&#8221; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_368"></a>368</span>She read it
      with a beaming face. Sherm was looking at her without seeing her. She
      started to tell him the contents of the letter, then suddenly stopped. She
      couldn&#8217;t rejoice over being asked to a hop when Sherm was in such
      trouble. Laying the letter in her lap, she took up Ernest&#8217;s. Sherm
      noticed the movement and, remembering, asked her what Carol had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      She handed him the letter. He read it through absently. The houses were
      thinning along the road. The prairie stretched ahead of them in solitary
      sweeps of tender green, dappled with flowers. Jane reached for the reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Read your letter, Sherm.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed in silence. Chicken Little kept her eyes on the road ahead. A
      sharp exclamation from Sherm startled her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;God, it can&#8217;t be true!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm swearing? She looked at him in amazement. The boy was not swearing;
      he had cried out in utter agony. He dropped the letter on the floor of the
      buggy and buried his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherm, Sherm, what is it?&#8221; Chicken Little was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer. He did not seem to have noticed that she had spoken.
      She reached over and touched him. &#8220;Sherm! Sherm!&#8221; He shook off
      her hand impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_369"></a>369</span>Chicken
      Little hesitated a moment, then flicked the horses into a swift trot. She
      must get him home. Perhaps he was going to be ill. The boy did not move or
      look up for miles. When the horses splashed through the ford at Elm Creek,
      he roused himself and looked dully at Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherm, please tell me. It will make it easier for you to tell
      somebody, and I&#8217;m worried to death.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped and picked up the letter. Smoothing it out, he thrust it into
      her hand. &#8220;Read it.&#8221; He took the reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little ran over the letter hurriedly. It bore a date some days
      previous.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;<span style="font-variant:small-caps">My Dear Boy:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Dr. Jones has just told me it can be only a question of days now. I
      have been studying whether to send for you or not. Father settled the
      question for me. He said he wanted sorrowfully to see you, but in view of
      the things that must be told you, it would be too painful an ordeal for
      all of us. He said to tell you you were very precious to him&#8211;as
      precious as if you had really been his own son.&#8221;

    <p>
      Chicken Little gave a little cry. &#8220;Sherm, what does she mean?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Read it all.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;For, Sherm, you are not our own. If Father could have lived, we
      never intended you to know <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_370"></a>370</span>this&#8211;at
      least not until you were a man and had made a place for yourself. But
      Father&#8217;s illness is leaving us penniless. Sue&#8217;s husband has
      offered Grace and myself a home with them, but he thinks you must be told
      the truth&#8211;that it is only fair to you. We took you when you were
      about two and a half years old under very peculiar circumstances. It was
      while we were still living in New York, and Sue was a tot of five. We were
      going up to my father&#8217;s in Albany and were a little late. Father
      told the hackman to drive fast; he&#8217;d give him an extra dollar if he&#8217;d
      catch the train. The man had been drinking and drove recklessly. He was
      just dashing round the corner to the station&#8211;the train was already
      whistling&#8211;when he knocked down, and ran over, a woman with a child
      in her arms. The child was pitched to one side and escaped with a few
      bruises. The woman never regained consciousness. You have probably guessed
      that you were that child. We could never find out who she was, though we
      advertised for several weeks. We decided to bring you up with Sue, and
      when we moved to Centerville, soon after, no one knew you were not our own
      child. We had you baptized Sherman after the great general who had just
      won his way to notice then. I have saved the clothing you wore, and a
      brooch and wedding ring of your mother&#8217;s. I will send them to you,
      together with a hundred dollars, which is all I can <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_371"></a>371</span> give you to start
      you on your way.&#8221; The remainder of the letter was filled with her
      grief over parting with her husband, and her separation from Sherm
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little swallowed hard&#8211;something seemed to be gripping her by
      the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;And your father isn&#8217;t your father, Sherm?&#8211;or your
      mother or Sue or Grace?&#8221; The tragic extent of what had happened was
      dawning slowly upon Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm&#8217;s lips trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, I&#8211;haven&#8217;t any father&#8211;I&#8217;ve never had a
      father!... I haven&#8217;t got anybody.... I haven&#8217;t even got a name
      that belongs to me!&#8221; Sherm&#8217;s voice grew shriller and shriller
      till it broke with a dry sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little slipped her hand into his and the boy clung to it
      spasmodically, as if that slim, brown hand were all he had in the world to
      cling to. The tears were raining down Jane&#8217;s cheeks, but Sherm&#8217;s
      eyes were dry and burning. The team trotted along evenly. They turned
      mechanically into the stable yard when they reached the ranch. It was
      growing dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm helped her out, saying: &#8220;Will you please tell them, Chicken
      Little? I won&#8217;t come in just yet.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran to the house and poured out her tale. Her <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_372"></a>372</span>father hurried to
      the stable. Sherm was not there. Jim Bart, who was milking in the corral
      near by, said he had saddled Caliph and gone off down the lane. Dr. Morton
      talked it over with Frank and they decided that Sherm had done the wisest
      thing possible in going for a gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t mean to do anything rash or he wouldn&#8217;t have
      taken Ernest&#8217;s horse,&#8221; Frank declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as hour after hour went by, the family grew more and more anxious. At
      eleven o&#8217;clock, Frank saddled Calico and tried to find him. He
      returned some time later in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You might as well try to look for a needle in a haystack. Poor lad,
      I have faith he will ride the worst of it off and Caliph is a pretty
      steady little beast now. He&#8217;ll bring him home.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments after his return, a messenger came from Captain Clarke,
      saying that he had been wakened by Caliph neighing at the gate and had
      gone out to find Sherm dazed and apparently completely exhausted. He had
      got him to bed where he was sleeping heavily. Captain Clarke was afraid
      they must be worried. He would care for him till morning, but he would be
      glad to have some inkling of what had happened so that he might know what
      to say to the boy when he waked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton got out his medicine case and went back with the man.

    <h2>
      THE CAPTAIN FINDS HIS OWN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Chicken Little climbed the hill of sleep painfully that night, and slept
      late the following morning in consequence. While she was eating breakfast,
      Frank came in with two tear-stained, dusty letters, which he had found in
      the bottom of the buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Is this the way you treat your correspondence, Sis?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;The idea&#8211;it&#8217;s Ernest&#8217;s and Katy&#8217;s letters
      and I never read them. Sherm&#8217;s trouble drove them clear out of my
      mind.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Evidently, one is torn part way open, and the other hasn&#8217;t
      been touched.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Hurry up and tell us what Ernest has to say. I was wondering why he
      hadn&#8217;t written.&#8221; Mrs. Morton paused expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_374"></a>374</span>&#8220;He
      says a lot of things,&#8221; replied Jane, skimming rapidly through the
      letter. &#8220;He says they are going to start on their summer cruise next
      week and the boys are tickled to death to go, though they&#8217;re
      probably just going to cruise around to Navy yards and see dry docks and
      improving things. He says that it&#8217;s rumored that Superintendent
      Balch is going away and Old Rodgers is coming back as superintendent. And
      this year&#8217;s class graduated three Japs&#8211;the Japanese government
      sent them over. He gives the names, but I can&#8217;t pronounce them. One
      is I-n-o-u-y-e.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Skip the Japs and give us the rest.&#8221; Frank was waiting to
      hear the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s about all that would interest you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My dear, anything concerning Ernest interests me,&#8221; protested
      her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;But it isn&#8217;t about Ernest; it&#8217;s about Carol Brown.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, nothing much&#8211;he just took a fancy to my picture and asked
      Ernest a lot of questions.&#8221; Chicken Little folded the letter and
      hastily slipped it back into the envelope, devoutly hoping her mother
      wouldn&#8217;t demand to see it. She tore open Katy&#8217;s. Before she
      had read two lines she gave a little cry of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, Mother, do you think I could? Oh, wouldn&#8217;t <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_375"></a>375</span>it be just too
      wonderful? Oh Mother, you must say Yes!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Jane, what are you talking about? Calm yourself and tell me.&#8221;
      Mrs. Morton looked up over her spectacles severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Why, she says her mother wants me to come and live with them next
      year and go to the High School and that Alice and Dick want me to come
      there. And, perhaps, I could stay part of the time at one house and part
      at the other, and for me to tell you and let you be thinking about it, and
      Alice and Mrs. Halford are both going to write you all about it, and&#8211;oh,
      Mother, wouldn&#8217;t it be too wonderful?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton looked both surprised and worried. &#8220;It is certainly most
      kind of them all, but I shall have to think the matter over.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well,&#8221; said Frank, &#8220;that doesn&#8217;t have to be
      settled to-day. Jane, Marian wishes to know if you want to go over to the
      Captain&#8217;s with her to see Sherm. She is going to start in a few
      minutes.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little jumped to her feet. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be ready in a jiffy!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm had still not wakened when they arrived. He had roused once toward
      morning; Captain Clarke had spoken to him, telling him where he was, then
      he had dropped quietly off to sleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke asked Chicken Little a good many questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_376"></a>376</span>&#8220;I
      should like to see that letter,&#8221; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s in his coat pocket. I tucked it in&#8211;I was afraid he&#8217;d
      lose it.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morton, who was still there, sat for several minutes in a brown study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I think,&#8221; he said presently, &#8220;that under the
      circumstances we should be justified in reading it without waiting for
      Sherm&#8217;s permission.&#8221; He looked at Captain Clarke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both read it and discussed it briefly. Still Sherm did not waken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I believe I&#8217;ll drive over to Jake Schmidt&#8217;s while I am
      waiting&#8211;I have an errand with him. Marian, don&#8217;t you want to
      ride over with me?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Captain Clarke,&#8221; said Jane rather timidly after they had
      gone, &#8220;would you mind showing me that picture of your baby again?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarke rose and brought the photograph. Chicken Little studied it
      carefully, then glanced up at the Captain. Sherm certainly was like the
      picture&#8211;as much like it as a boy who was almost a man grown could
      be. Should she dare to ask him? Chicken Little felt herself growing hot
      and cold by turns. Her heart was beating so she thought the Captain must
      surely hear it. One minute she was sure she didn&#8217;t dare, the next,
      she remembered Sherm&#8217;s broken-hearted words about not belonging
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_377"></a>377</span>to anybody,
      and she was sure she could screw her courage up&#8211;in just a minute.
      Captain Clarke helped her out. He had been observing her restless
      movements for several minutes and was wondering if she could possibly have
      guessed what was in his own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Out with it, little woman, what&#8217;s troubling you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little got up from her seat and went and stood close beside him.
      &#8220;I want to say something to you awfully, only I am afraid you&#8211;won&#8217;t
      like it,&#8221; she said earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;My dear child, don&#8217;t be afraid of me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little summoned up her resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I wanted to ask&#8211;to ask you, if you wouldn&#8217;t adopt
      Sherm. You see he looks like your little boy would have looked, and he
      hasn&#8217;t got anybody or any name, and he isn&#8217;t going to want to
      live hardly, I am afraid. And I thought.... You don&#8217;t know how fine
      Sherm is. He&#8217;s so honorable and kind&#8211;so&#8211;so you can trust
      him. I just know you&#8217;d be proud of him after a while.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was pleading with eyes and voice and trembling hands. The
      Captain gazed at her a moment in astonishment, then he tenderly drew her
      toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Chicken Little, I doubt if Sherm would agree to that. But if he is
      willing, I should be proud and happy to call him my son. But don&#8217;t
      get your hopes <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_378"></a>378</span>up&#8211;I
      fear Sherm is too proud to let us find any such easy solution of his
      troubles. But we&#8217;ll find a way to put him on his feet, you and I&#8211;we&#8217;ll
      find a way, if it takes every cent I have!
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I think perhaps the first thing to do, Chicken Little,&#8221; he
      continued after some pondering, &#8220;is to try to find out something
      about Sherman&#8217;s real parentage. It hardly seems possible that a
      comfortably dressed woman could have disappeared with her child without
      making some stir. I am in hopes, by getting somebody to search through the
      files of two or three of the leading New York newspapers immediately
      following the day of the accident, we might secure a clue. I shall write
      to Mrs. Dart at once for particulars, and then send to a man I know and
      pay him to make a thorough investigation.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were so interested discussing what could be done, that Sherm entered
      the room before they knew he was awake. The boy was calm, but looked years
      older, and very white and worn. Captain Clarke greeted him cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I hope you rested. Jane tells me you had a staggering day
      yesterday. Chicken Little, would you mind telling Wing to serve Sherm&#8217;s
      breakfast?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she disappeared, he gripped the boy&#8217;s hand, saying
      confidently, &#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to talk about your trouble just now
      and I have no words to comfort you for your loss, lad, but I want to tell
      you not <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_379"></a>379</span>to
      begin to worry yet about your identity. I believe we shall find a way to
      get track of your people and that you will find you have an honorable
      name, and, possibly, a living father to make up a little for the kind
      foster-father you have lost.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how we could&#8211;after all these years.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Will you leave the matter to me for a few days? And Sherm, make an
      effort to eat something for Chicken Little&#8217;s sake&#8211;she is
      worrying her heart out over your trouble. You have some good friends right
      here&#8211;don&#8217;t forget that. Dr. Morton watched by you all night.
      Brace up and be a man. I know you have it in you, Sherm.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Letters came to Sherm in a short time from Sue Dart, from Dick and Alice
      Harding, and from Mrs. Halford, who painstakingly wrote him all the
      details of his supposed father&#8217;s last days. She evidently knew
      nothing of his not being the Dart&#8217;s own son. Sue&#8217;s letter
      seemed to comfort him a little. He did not show it to anyone, even to
      Chicken Little. He confided to her, however, that the folks were sending
      his things to him the next day. They had already broken up the home and
      were going back to Chicago with Sue the following week.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the express package arrived, Sherm took it straight to Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You open it,&#8221; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little took his knife and cut the string and <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_380"></a>380</span>folded back the
      paper wrappings carefully. It seemed some way as if she were meeting Sherm&#8217;s
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quaint little old-fashioned garments were musty and faded. A frock of
      blue merino braided in an elaborate pattern in black lay on top. There was
      a cape to match, and a little cloth cap. Beside these lay a funny pair of
      leather boots with red tops&#8211;almost like a man&#8217;s&#8211;only,
      oh, so tiny!
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little hardly knew whether to laugh or cry at these.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, Sherm, did you ever wear them? How you must have strutted! I
      can fairly see you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm smiled and took them up tenderly. Did he, too, feel as if there were
      another presence haunting these relics of his childhood?
    </p>
    <p>
      The tiny yellowed undergarments came next, all made by hand with minute
      even stitches. A pair of blue and white striped knitted stockings was
      folded with these, and last, at the bottom, a little pasteboard box
      appeared, containing a ring, a brooch, and a flat oval locket on a fine
      gold chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm examined the ring first. Inside was inscribed William-Juanita. May
      1860.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brooch contained a lock of dark hair under a glass; the whole set in a
      twisted rim of gold. The locket held miniatures of a white-haired man and
      woman with foreign-looking faces. Both Sherm and <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_381"></a>381</span>Chicken Little
      looked these over in silence. Presently Sherm sighed, then laid the
      trinkets all back in Chicken Little&#8217;s lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything there that could help much,&#8221; he
      said hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little slowly folded up the little garments and laid them neatly
      back in their wrapping. Her brow was puckered into a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I am trying to think where I have heard that name Juanita&#8211;some
      place lately. I don&#8217;t remember ever to have known anybody by that
      name. It&#8217;s Spanish, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I guess so, but what you&#8217;re thinking of is the song, &#8216;Juanita.&#8217;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I expect it is. Sherm, do you mind if I take these things over
      and show them to Captain Clarke? He said he would like to see them when
      they came.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;No, take them along. If you&#8217;ll wait till I get the feeding
      done, I&#8217;ll go with you.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;All right, let&#8217;s take Calico and Caliph.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm lingered out on the veranda while Chicken Little displayed the
      contents of the package to the Captain. He examined each little article of
      clothing for some identifying mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;There doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything to help on those,&#8221; he
      said, disappointed. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have a look at the jewelry.&#8221;

      Chicken Little unwrapped the ring from its layers <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_382"></a>382</span>of tissue paper,
      and handed it to him. Captain Clarke took it, regarded the flat golden
      circle intently for an instant, then turned it to read the inscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pained cry broke from his lips. Chicken Little glanced hastily up to
      find him holding the ring in shaking fingers, staring off into vacancy.
      &#8220;Juanita!&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;Juanita!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little touched his hands in distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Captain&#8211;Captain Clarke, what is it?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at her with a start. &#8220;I&#8211;it is&#8212;Excuse me a
      moment, Chicken Little.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked into his bedroom with the ring still in his hand and closed the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little waited and waited, not knowing whether she ought to go and
      tell Sherm what she suspected. It seemed too strange to be possible. And
      if it were true, surely Captain Clarke would want to tell him himself.
      Perhaps she oughtn&#8217;t to be there. She rose softly and slipped out to
      Wing in the kitchen. After a time she heard Sherm get up from his seat on
      the veranda step and go into the library. Immediately after, the bedroom
      door opened and she heard the murmur of voices. She left a message with
      Wing and running quietly out to Calico, untied him, and rode home in the
      twilight.

      &#8220;You needn&#8217;t ever say again, Ernest Morton,&#8221; <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_383"></a>383</span>she wrote to her
      brother the next evening, &#8220;that E. P. Roe&#8217;s stories are too
      goody-goody and fishy to be interesting. He can&#8217;t hold a candle to
      what&#8217;s happened to the Captain and Sherm. I have to go round
      pinching myself to believe it is really so. I am almost afraid I will wake
      up and find it isn&#8217;t, still. Do you remember the picture of the
      Captain&#8217;s little boy that looked like Sherm? Well, it was Sherm. I
      can hear you say: &#8216;What in the dickens?&#8217; So, I&#8217;ll put
      you out of suspense right away. The Captain&#8217;s boy was not dead, only
      lost, and he is Sherm or Sherm is he, whichever way is right&#8211;I&#8217;m
      sure I don&#8217;t know. You see the Captain went off on a long voyage and
      got shipwrecked and was gone ages and ages. And Juanita&#8217;s father and
      mother were way off in California&#8211;they used to be Spanish. That&#8217;s
      what made them so foreign-looking in the locket picture. Well, nobody
      knows exactly what happened. When the Captain got back to New York and
      hunted up the boarding house where she had lived, they said she had left
      six months before to go to her parents in California. Captain Clarke wrote
      to California and found that her father was dead and her mother hadn&#8217;t
      heard from Juanita for months, and didn&#8217;t know anything about her
      coming home. Wasn&#8217;t it dreadful? He paid detectives to hunt her up,
      but they never found the slightest clue. The Captain thought she&#8217;d
      gone off and left him on purpose&#8211;that&#8217;s <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_384"></a>384</span> what made him such
      a woman-hater&#8211;and so sad all the time. You wouldn&#8217;t know him
      now. He looks like Merry Christmas all the year round. You should see him
      gaze at Sherm. Marian says it makes her want to cry, and Mother says it is
      the most wonderful manifestation of Providence she has ever known. It
      seems to me Providence would show more sense not to muddle things up so in
      the first place. Sherm is as pleased as can be to find he really is
      somebody, and he&#8217;s awfully fond of the Captain, but you see he&#8217;d
      got so used to loving the Darts as his own folks that he can&#8217;t get
      unused to it all of a sudden. He choked all up when he tried to call
      Captain Clarke &#8216;Father,&#8217; and the Captain told him not to.
      There&#8217;s heaps more to tell, but Mother has been calling me for the
      past three minutes.&#8221;
    </p>
    <hr style="border:none; border-bottom:1px solid silver; height: 1px; width: 80%; text-align: center; margin: 10px auto;" />
    <p>
      &#8220;No wonder Sherm feels dazed,&#8221; said Dr. Morton two evenings
      later, watching the boy, who was making a vain pretense of playing
      checkers with Chicken Little.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so heedless that she swept his men off the board at each move, to
      Chicken Little&#8217;s disgust. Sherm usually beat her when he gave his
      mind to the game. Presently, she picked up the board and dumped the
      checkers off into her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;A penny for your thoughts, Sherm.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_385"></a>385</span>&#8220;I was
      just wondering if Captain&#8211;Father&#8211;would find out anything more
      in New York.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;How long will he be gone?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I guess that depends on whether he gets track of anything new.
      After he comes back we&#8217;re going to Chicago to see&#8211;Mother.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, I am so glad. It will make you feel a lot better to have a good
      visit with them all.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, and he told me I might buy back the old home for her if she
      wants it&#8211;if I&#8217;d only known last week, she needn&#8217;t have
      sold the place. And the Captain&#8211;Father&#8211;says he will give me
      some money to put out at interest so she&#8217;ll have enough to live on
      comfortably. He says he owes her and Father a debt he can never repay for
      bringing me up.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little was thoughtful. &#8220;Sherm, he seems to have plenty of
      money, maybe you can go to college and to the Beaux Arts, too.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;He said I could have all the education I wanted.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Will you go to college next year?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Yep.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;O dear, it will be awful here unless Mother lets me go to
      Centerville.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t fret, she is going to.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;How do you know?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;She told Marian so last night.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little got to her feet and shot two feet <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_386"></a>386</span>into the air with a
      whoop of joy. &#8220;Goody! Goody!! Goody!!!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Save a little breath, Jane. I know something better than that.
      Promise you won&#8217;t tell&#8211;your mother would skin me if she knew I
      were giving away her cherished plans.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, she just wants me to act surprised, and I
      can do it a lot better if I know about it before hand.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, she&#8217;s coming on at Christmas time for a visit in
      Centerville, and she&#8217;s going to take you on to visit Ernest.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Sherm, truly?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s what she said.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little gave an ecstatic hop. &#8220;Sherm,&#8221; she exclaimed
      presently, a new idea striking her, &#8220;I can go to that hop with
      Carol!&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Carol?&#8221; Sherm sat up a little straighter. &#8220;What do you
      mean?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember that letter I got from Carol? You don&#8217;t
      remember a single thing about it, do you? He wrote to ask me if I wouldn&#8217;t
      come on some time and go to a Navy hop with him. He said he was asking me
      in time so I couldn&#8217;t promise anybody else.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;It strikes me Carol is getting mighty fresh.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little stole a surprised glance at Sherm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything fresh about that&#8211;I think it <span
      class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_387"></a>387</span>nice of him to
      remember me so long. My, I used to think Carol was the most wonderful
      thing. I hung a May basket to him the last spring we were in Centerville.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;You did? Why, I thought I got yours. Who hung mine?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Gertie. I guess she won&#8217;t mind if I tell&#8211;it&#8217;s
      been so long.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm whistled. After a little he inquired rather sheepishly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Say, Chicken Little, you don&#8217;t like Carol best now, do you?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little looked up hastily. She was disgusted to feel her face
      growing hot. &#8220;Why, Sherm&#8211;I haven&#8217;t seen Carol for four
      years. I don&#8217;t know what I should think of him now.&#8221; Then,
      seeing the hurt look in Sherm&#8217;s eyes, she added: &#8220;I guess I&#8217;d
      have to like him pretty awfully well, if I did.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Captain Clarke was gone two weeks and he had added only two facts to those
      they had been able to piece together. He had accidentally run across an
      old friend. This friend had supposed him dead all these years, and could
      scarcely believe his own eyes when he saw him. From him, he learned that
      his wife had also believed him dead before she would consent to leave New
      York. This friend told him he had suspected that her money was running low
      and <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_388"></a>388</span>had
      offered to help her, but she refused. He thought, after hearing the
      Captain&#8217;s story, that she must have had barely enough left to take
      her home, and that this explained why she was walking to the wharf instead
      of taking a hack, the day she was run down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherm stayed on with the Morton&#8217;s until the following week when he
      set out with his new-found father to visit his adopted family. Youth
      recovers readily from its sorrows. It was almost the old Sherm who raised
      his cap to Chicken Little as the train got under steam and slid away from
      the long wooden platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;O dear!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;seems to me I haven&#8217;t
      done anything this whole year but see somebody off. I think it ought to be
      my turn pretty soon.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Have a little patience, Humbug,&#8221; said her father, &#8220;your
      turn is almost here. It is hard for me to realize how fast my baby is
      growing up.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Little liked the sound of those words&#8211;&#8220;growing up.&#8221;
      There was something magical about them. They lingered in her mind for
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hot Sunday afternoon late in June, she arrayed herself in an old blue
      lawn dress of Marian&#8217;s that trailed a full inch on the floor at
      every step. She coiled her hair high on her head and tucked in a rose
      coquettishly above her ear. Highly gratified with the result of her
      efforts, she swept downstairs in a most dignified manner to astonish the
      family. <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_389"></a>389</span>Unfortunately
      the family&#8211;Father and Mother, and both pups, were taking a siesta.
      She went over to the cottage; a profound silence reigned there also. She
      rambled around restlessly for a few moments, then, taking &#8220;Ivanhoe&#8221;
      and a pocketful of cookies, went out into the orchard. It was hot even
      there. The air seemed heavy and the birds contented themselves with lazy
      chirpings. She swung herself up into her favorite tree and began to munch
      and read.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not read long. The charm of the green world around her was
      greater than the pictured world of the book. Chicken Little fell to making
      pictures of her own&#8211;dream pictures that changed quickly into other
      dream pictures, as real dreams sometimes do. As she stared down the leafy
      arcades between the rows of apple trees, she saw an immense ball room hung
      in red, white, and blue bunting and filled with astonishingly handsome
      young men in blue uniforms. Ernest was there. And a tall, curly-headed
      Adonis, who looked both like, and unlike, the good-natured, plump Carol of
      Old Centerville days, was close beside her. But when the supposed Carol
      spoke, it was certainly Sherm&#8217;s voice she heard, and it was Sherm&#8217;s
      odd, crooked smile that curved the dream midshipman&#8217;s lips. Chicken
      Little recognized the absurdity of this herself and laughed happily. A
      bird on a bough nearby took this for a challenge, and burst into an
      ecstasy of trills.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_390"></a>390</span>&#8220;Pshaw,&#8221;
      she whispered to herself, &#8220;I wonder what it would really be like.&#8221;
      She kept on wondering. She felt as if she and the orchard were wrapped
      about with a great cloud, like a veil, and that beyond this, all the
      wonderful things that must surely happen when she grew up, were hidden.
      The twilight was falling before she stretched her cramped limbs and slid
      down the rough tree trunk. She picked up her neglected book, which had
      fallen to the ground unnoticed, and said aloud, with a little mocking
      curtsey:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Your pardon, Sir Walter, but I made a romance of my own that was&#8211;nicer.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she tucked the slighted author under her arm and flew to the house
      before the pursuing shadows. Chicken Little was growing up.

        UNCLE BILL&#8217;S LETTERS TO HIS NIECE
      </p>
      <p class="tp" style="">
        By RAY BROWN
      </p>
      <p>
        Here&#8217;s as gay a little gift as any girl could wish. Bright,
        sparkling and joyous&#8211;letters from a matter-of-fact old uncle who
        talks to his young niece straight from the shoulder, exactly as he might
        to a boy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uncle Bill gives facts about moonlight, becomes violent over athletics,
        taboos snobbery, takes a fling at heredity, and touches up a few
        complexions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is extravagantly and deliciously funny&#8211;Just the Book

        Over the Seas for Uncle Sam

        Miss Sterne is Senior Lieutenant of the Navy League Honor Guard, which
        has charge of entertainment and visitation in behalf of sick and wounded
        sailors sent home for hospital treatment. Their experiences, such as may
        be published at this time, now appear in book form. This book brings out
        many thrilling adventures that have occurred in the war zone of the high
        seas&#8211;and has official sanction. Miss Sterne&#8217;s descriptive
        powers are equaled by few. She has the dramatic touch which compels
        interest. Her book, which contains many photographic scenes, will be
        warmly welcomed in navy circles, and particularly by those in active
        service.

        Ambulancing on the French Front
      </p>
      <p class="tp" style="">
        By EDWARD P. COYLE
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a collection of intensely interesting episodes related by a
        Young American who served as a volunteer with the French Army&#8211;Red
        Cross Division. His book is to the field of mercy what those of Empey,
        Holmes and Peat have been in describing the vicissitudes of army life.
        The author spent ten months in ambulance work on the Verdun firing line.
        What he saw and did is recounted with most graphic clearness. This book
        contains many illustrations photographed on the spot showing with vivid
        exactitude the terrors of rescue work under the fire of the big guns.
